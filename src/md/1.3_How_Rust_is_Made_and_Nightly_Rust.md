# How Rust is Made and “Nightly Rust”

---
class: left

# Release Cycle Philosophy

* Balance **stability** and **feature implementation**

* Moto is “stability without stagnation” 

---
class: left

# Development and Release

* Development is done on the master branch

* release channels

  * Nightly : Every night a new rust version is released

  * Beta : Every six weeks the Nightly release is made beta

  * Stable : Every six weeks a stable version is released too

* Called train model

# Unstable Features

* **feature flags** determine what features are enabled in a given release

* Nightly will be behind feature flags

* Beta won't have feature flags; helps to test out the integration

# rustup

```bash
$ rustup install nightly
```

Installs rust nightly

```bash
$ rustup toolchain list
stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc (default)
beta-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

* Shows the list of rust versions installed 

* **(default)** shows the system wide default rust version

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/needs-nightly
$ rustup override add nightly
```

Overrides the rust version for the specific project

# The RFC Process and Teams

* Rust follows **Request For Comments** (RFC) process. 

* If you’d like an improvement in Rust, you can write up a proposal, called an RFC.

* There are teams for each stream and they review the RFC

* Once accepted, an issues is opened on the respository

* After implemented, it will land in `master` branch behind a feature flag

* On testing, feature flag is removed and moved to beta and final release

# Summary

* Moto is “stability without stagnation” 

* Follows **Train Model** for releases

* Release cycle is every **six weeks**

* **rustup** installs and setup multiple versions and nightly
