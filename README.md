# The Rust Programming Language - Gist

The idea is to create gist of [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/) for quick reference and presentations.

Its WIP and contributions are welcome! 😍 

You can find the source here...https://github.com/cg-cnu/rust-lang-gist 🎉

Inspired by [A very brief intro to Rust](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/a-very-brief-intro-to-rust) and [Rust in Ten slides](https://github.com/steveklabnik/rust-in-ten-slides).
