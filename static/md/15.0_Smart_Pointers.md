# Smart Pointers

---

class: left

# Pointers

* A pointer is a variable that contains an address in memory

* This address refers to, or “points at,” some other data

---

# Refernces

* The most common kind of pointer in Rust is a reference

* References are indicated by the `&` symbol and borrow the value they point to

* They don't special capabilities other than refering to data

* They don't have any overhead

* References are the most commonly used pointers

# Smart Pointers

* Smart pointers are data structures that act like a pointer but also have
  additional metadata and capabilities

* Smart pointers defined in the standard library provide extra functionality beyond that provided
  by references

* **Reference counting smart pointer** : Enables you to have multiple owners of
  data by keeping track of the number of owners and, when no owners remain,
  taking care of cleaning up the data.

* `String` and `Vec<T>` are smart pointers because

  * They own some memory and allow you to manipulate it.

  * They also have metadata (such as their capacity) and

  * extra capabilities or guarantees

* References are pointers that only borrow data; in contrast, in many cases,
  smart pointers own the data they point to.

* They are usually implemented using structs

# Rust vs Structs

* The characteristic that distinguishes a smart pointer from an ordinary struct is that smart pointers implement the `Deref` and `Drop` traits

* The `Deref` trait allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference so we can write code that works with either references or smart pointers.

* The `Drop` trait allows us to customize the code that is run when an instance of the smart pointer goes out of scope.

# types of smart pointers

* Many libraries have their own smart pointers, and you can even write your own

  * Box<T> for allocating values on the heap

  * Rc<T>, a reference counted type that enables multiple ownership

  * Ref<T> and RefMut<T>, accessed through RefCell<T>, a type that enforces the
    borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time
