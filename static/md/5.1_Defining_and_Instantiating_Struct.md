# Defining and Instantiating Struct

---

class: left

# Struct

* A struct or structure, is a custom data type that lets us name and package
  together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group

* Its like tuples but with names

* Can be composed of different types

* They are like an object’s data attributes in Object Oriented Languages

---

class: left

# Define a Struct

* Structs are defined with **struct** keyword, follwed by name, starting
  with capital letter

* Name should determine the significance of pieces of data grouped together

* Inside **{}** we define the name and type of the peices of data called `fields`

```rust
struct User {
  username: String,
  age: u32,
  active: bool,
}
```

---

class: left

# Create Struct instance

```rust
let mut user1 = User {
  username: String::from("someusername123"),
  active: true,
  age: 31,
};
```

* The struct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances
  fill in that template with particular data to create values of the type

* No need to define in the same order we declared
  <!-- can we miss few values from the declaration or add them ? -->

---

class: left

# Access or change Struct values

* Use dot notation

```rust
  println!(user1.username);
  user1.username = Srting::from("anotherusername123")
```

* To change a field, entire object must be mutable

* No single field mutability

---

class: left

# Related Function

Struct as the last expression in the function body, implicitly return a new
instance

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
  User {
      email: email,
      username: username,
      active: true,
      sign_in_count: 1,
  }
}
```

---

class: left

# Field init shorthand

You can ignore the value if both the field and the variable have the same name

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
  User {
      email,
      username,
      active: true,
      sign_in_count: 1,
  }
}
```

---

class: left

# update struct

Uses most of an old instance’s values, but changes some

```rust
let user2 = User {
  email: String::from("another@example.com"),
  username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
  active: user1.active,
  sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
};
```

---

class: left

# Struct update syntax

Instead of repeating all the fields `..` specifies that the fields not
explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance

```rust
let user2 = User {
  email: String::from("another@example.com"),
  username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
  ..user1
};
```

Instance should be at the end and shouldn't have a **,** like regular fields

---

class: left

# Tuple structs

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
```

* Gives the whole tuple a name and make it a different type than other tuples

* But naming each field like a regular struct would be verbose or redundant

* `struct` keyword follwed by tuple name and the types of data in `()`

---

class: left

# Examples

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

* Black and origin are of different types, they are not of type `tuple`

* Destructure and access individual values with . follwed by their index

---

class: left

# Unit like structs

Structs that don’t have any fields

```rust
struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
```

* They behave similar to `()`

* Useful, when you need to implement a trait on some type, but don't have data

---

class: left

# Summary

* A custom data type that names and packages multiple related values

* use **..** for updating struct

* struct as last expression in function returns a new instance

* Struct tuples are useful when naming each field is verbose

* unit like structs are similar to `()`
