# How to Write Tests

Tests are Rust functions that verify that the non-test code is functioning in
the expected manner

Test functions typically perform these three actions...

  * Set up any needed data or state

  * Run the code we want to test

  * Assert the results are what we expect

# The Anatomy of a Test Function

* Test is a function thatâ€™s annotated with the `test` attribute

* Attributes are metadata about pieces of Rust code

* `#[test]` above `fn` makes it a test function

* `cargo test` will run all the test functions and report on their status

---

# Default test

Running `cargo lib` will generate the `src/lib.rs` with the default test

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
```

* `#[test]` attribute denotes the test function

* Can also have non-test functions in the tests module to help set up common
  scenarios or perform common operations

* `assert_eq!` macro to assert that 2 + 2 equals 4

# Result

```text
$ cargo test
   Compiling adder v0.1.0 (file:///projects/adder)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.22 secs
     Running target/debug/deps/adder-ce99bcc2479f4607

running 1 test
test tests::it_works ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out

   Doc-tests adder

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out
```

* `Compiling`, `Finished`, and `Running` are the initial steps

* `running 1 test` show the number of tests run...

* `test tests::it_works ... ok` shows the test ran and the status of the test

* `1 passed; 0 failed` will show the number of tests passed and failed

* `0 ignored; 0 filtered` shows the ignored and filtered tests

* `0 measured` shows the benchmark tests

* `Doc-tests adder` shows the tests run as part of the documentation

* Rust can compile any code examples that appears in our documentation

* This helps the examples to stay in sync with the code

# Failing tests

* Each thread is run in a different thread

* If any test fails, it will be reported back to the main thread

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn exploration() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
    #[test]
    fn another() {
        panic!("Make this test fail");
    }
}
```

# Checking Results with the assert! Macro

* `assert!` is a  macro, provided by the standard library

* `assert!` macro takes an argument that evaluates to a Boolean

* If the value is

  * `true`, assert! does nothing and the test passes

  * `false`, the assert! macro calls the panic! macro, which causes the test to
    fail.

* Ensure that some condition in a test evaluates to true
