# Variables

Variables are declared using `let`

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

```rust
The value of x is: 5
```

---

class: left

# Constants

Constants are declared using `const`

```rust
fn main() {
  const PIG_COUNT = 5;
  println!("The total no of pigs are: {}", PIG_COUNT);
}
```

```rust
The total no of pigs are: 5
```

Valid for the entire run of the program in the defined scope

**convention:** Use all upper case with underscores between words

# Variables and Mutability

Variables are immutable by default

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
  x = 6;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

```rust
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - first assignment to `x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

class: left

Add `mut` to make variables mutable

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut x = 5;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
  x = 6;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

```rust
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6
```

`mut` will let you change the value not the type

# Immutable vs Constants

* `immutable` is different from `const`

* Constants aren’t only immutable by default, they’re always immutable

* Can't assign functions to `const`

* Can't use if expressions with const

* Can't use `mut` with `constants`

# Shadowing

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;

  let x = x + 1;

  let x = x * 2;

  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

When declaring a new variable using `let` with the same name as the old variable,
the new variable is shadowing the old one

* It helps perform transformations on immutable variables

* It effectively creates a new variable with the same name

---

class: left

# Mutable vs Shadowing

* `mut` changes the value where as `shadowing` creates a new variable

* `mut` will only change the value not the type

* `shadowing` gives the flexibility of changing the type of the variable

```rust
let spaces = "   "; // type of String
let spaces = spaces.len(); // type of integer
```

# Summary

* `let` declares a variable

* `mut` makes it mutable

* `const` declares a constant

* `const` can't be mutable

* `shadowing` effectively creates new variables
