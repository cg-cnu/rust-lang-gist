# What Does Object-Oriented Mean?

---

class: left

# Common characterestics

* Rust is influenced by many different programming paradigms 

* `OOP` is one of them

* No consensus on what features a language needs in order to be called 
  object-oriented

* They tend to share certain common characteristics...

  * objects
  
  * encapsulation

  * inheritance

# Objects Contain Data and Behavior

```text
Object-oriented programs are made up of objects. 
An object packages both data and the procedures that operate on that data.
The procedures are typically called methods or operations 
- The Gang of Four book
```

* Even though `structs` and `enums` with methods aren’t called objects, they 
  provide the same functionality

* So, Rust is Object Oriented according to this definition

---

class: left

# Encapsulation that Hides Implementation Details

* Implementation details of an object aren’t accessible to code using that object

* The only way to interact with an object therefore is through its public API

* Code using the object should not be able to change data or behavior directly

* By default all the functions, types in Rust are private

* `pub` lets us make them public 

* The option to use pub or not enables encapsulation of implementation details

* Then Rust is an Object Oriented according to this rule

---

class: left

# Inheritance as a Type System and as Code Sharing

* An object can inherit from another object’s definition

* Gaining the parent object’s data and behavior without defining again

* struct dosen't inherit parent struct’s fields and method implementations

* Rust is not object-oriented by this definition


---

class: left

# Other Solutions

* Rust provides other solutions, based on your reason for choosing inheritance

  * Re-use of code 

  * Type system

---

class: left

# Inheritance : Re-use of code

* Implement particular behavior for one type and re-use it for a different type

* Rust provides default trait method implementations

* Define a trait with default method 

* Any type implementing the trait would have that default method available 

* Similar to a parent class having an implementation of a method, and an 
  inheriting child class then also having the implementation of the method

* We can Override the default method like child can override the parent method

---

class: left

# Inheritance : Type System aka Polymorphism

* To enable a child type to be used in the same places as the parent type

* Multiple objects can be substituted for each other if they share certain 
  characteristics

---

class: left

# Polymorphism

* Inheritance for type system is also called Polymorphism

* Genrally, polymorphism is synonymous with inheritance

* General concept that refers to code that can work with data of multiple types

* For inheritance, those types are generally subclasses

* Rust instead uses...

  * generics to abstract over different possible types

  * trait bounds to impose constraints on what those types must provide
  
* This is called `bounded parametric polymorphism`

---

class: left

# Inheriance 

* Fallen out of favor as a programming design solution

* It’s often at risk of sharing more code than needed

* Subclasses shouldn’t always share all characteristics of their parent class, 
  but will do so with inheritance

* Some languages only allow a subclass to inherit from one class

* Rust chose to take a different approach, using trait objects instead of 
  inheritance

# Summary

Rust is inspired by lot of paradigmns including `OOP`

Common characteristics of Object Oriented programms and Rust's solution to it

* Objects Contain Data and Behavior : 

  * `struct` with methods

* Encapsulation that Hides Implementation Details : 
  
  * `pub` to control the client API

* Inheritance as Code re-use : 

  * `traits` with default methods

* Inheritance as a Type System Aka Polymorphism : 

  * It’s often at risk of sharing more code than needed

  * `generics` to abstract over different possible types
