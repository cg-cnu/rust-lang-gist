# Hash Maps

# Hash Maps Store Keys Associated with Values

* `HashMap<K, V>` stores a mapping of keys of type `K` to values of type `V`

* `hashing function` determines how it places these keys and values into memory

* Useful when you want to look up data by using a key that can be of any type

* Use case: Team score in a game

#  Creating a New Hash Map

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
```

* Unlike other collections, it is not included in the scope automatically

* hash maps store their data on the heap

* Hash maps are homogeneous 

    * all of the keys must have the same type

    * and all of the values must have the same type

---
class: left

#  Another way of creating a New Hash Map

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
let teams  = vec![String::from("Blue"), String::from("Yellow")];
let initial_scores = vec![10, 50];
let scores: HashMap<_, _> = teams.iter().zip(initial_scores.iter()).collect();
  ```
  
Another way of creating a hashmap is to use collect method on a vector of tuples, 
where each tuple consists of a key and its value

# updating a Hash Map

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
let field_value = String::from("Blue");

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(&field_name, &field_value);
```

* the number of keys and values is growable

* But, each key can only have one value associated with it at a time

* Insert values into hashmap with `insert` method which takes (key, value) as 
arguments -->

# Hash Maps and Ownership

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
let field_value = 4;

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(field_name, field_value);
// field_name is invalid and field_value is valid
```

* For scalar types like `<i32>` which implements copy trait, data is copied
  
* For types like `String`, value will be moved and hashmap will be the owner

* For references, values must be valid for at least as long as the hash map is
  valid

# Accessing Values in a Hash Map

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

let team_name = String::from("Blue");
let score = scores.get(&team_name);
```

Get a value out of the hash map by providing its key to the get method

# Iterating over hashmap

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

for (key, value) in &scores {
  println!("{}: {}", key, value);
}
```

```rust
Yellow: 50
Blue: 10
```

* Will print in an arbitary order

class: left

# Updating a Hash Map

* The number of keys and values are growable 

* But, each key can have only one value associated with it at a time

* When updating, we have to decide how to handle the case when

  * If key already exists, overwrite old value

  * Insert only if the key has no value 

  * Updating a Value Based on the Old Value

---
class: left

# If key already exists, Overwrite old Value

`insert` will overwrite the value, else will create

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

```rust
{"Blue": 25}
```

`insert` will take the key value pair...

  * Will create if the key don't exist

  * Will overwrite if it already exist

---
class: left

# Only Insert If the Key Has No Value

`entry` will return the key status and update based on it

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);

scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

```rust
{"Yellow": 50, "Blue": 10}
```

* `entry` takes the key we want to check as a parameter

* returns an `enum` called `Entry` that represents a value that might 
  or might not exist

* Since blue already exists it won't update

---
class: left

# Updating a Value Based on the Old Value

`entry` will look up key's status and update it based on the old value

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let text = "hello world wonderful world";

let mut map = HashMap::new();

for word in text.split_whitespace() {
    let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
    *count += 1;
}

println!("{:?}", map);
```

```rust
{"world": 2, "hello": 1, "wonderful": 1}
```

# Hashing Function

* HashMap uses a cryptographically secure hashing function that can provide 
  resistance to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

* If its slow, you can switch to another function by specifying a different hasher

* Lot of them are available in crates.io

# Summary

* HashMap<K, V> stores a mapping of keys of type K to values of type V

* Create new hash map with `let mut scores = HashMap::new();`

* Access values by `.get(<key>)` method

* insert - will create if don't exist else update
