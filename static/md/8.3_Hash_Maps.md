# Hash Maps

# Hash Maps Store Keys Associated with Values

* `HashMap<K, V></K>` stores a mapping of keys of type `K` to values of type `V`

* `hashing function` determines how it places these keys and values into memory

* Useful for when you want to look up data by using a key that can be of any type

#  Creating a New Hash Map

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
```

* Unlike other collections, it is not included in the scope automatically

* Like vectors

  * hash maps store their data on the heap

  * Hash maps are homogeneous 

      * all of the keys must have the same type

      * and all of the values must have the same type

#  Another way of creating a New Hash Map

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
let teams  = vec![String::from("Blue"), String::from("Yellow")];
let initial_scores = vec![10, 50];
let scores: HashMap<_, _> = teams.iter().zip(initial_scores.iter()).collect();
  ```
  
  Another way of creating a hashmap is collect method on a vector of tuples, 
  where each tuple consists of a key and its value

# Hash Maps and Ownership

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
let field_value = 4;

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(field_name, field_value);
// field_name is invalid and field_value is valid
```

* For scalar types like `<i32>` which implements copy trait, data is copied
  
* For types like `String`, value will be moved and hashmap will be the owner

---
class: left

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
let field_value = String::from("Blue");

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(&field_name, &field_value);
// field_name and field_value are invalid at this point
```

* For references the values wonâ€™t be moved into the hash map.
The values must be valid for at least as long as the hash map is valid

# Accessing Values in a Hash Map

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

let team_name = String::from("Blue");
let score = scores.get(&team_name);
```

Get a value out of the hash map by providing its key to the get method

# Iterating over hashmap

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

for (key, value) in &scores {
  println!("{}: {}", key, value);
}
```

```rust
Yellow: 50
Blue: 10
```
* Will print in an arbitary order

# Updating a Hash Map

* The number of keys and values is growable 

* But, each key can only have one value associated with it at a time

* When updating, we have to decide how to handle the case when

  * Insert only if the key has no value 

  * If key already exists, overwrite old value

  * Updating a Value Based on the Old Value

---
class: left

# Overwriting a Value

`insert` will overwrite the value

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```


---
class: left

# Only Insert If the Key Has No Value

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);

scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

* `entry` takes the key we want to check as a parameter

* returns an `enum` called `Entry` that represents a value that might 
  or might not exist.

# Updating a Value Based on the Old Value

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let text = "hello world wonderful world";

let mut map = HashMap::new();

for word in text.split_whitespace() {
    let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
    *count += 1;
}

println!("{:?}", map);
```

```rust
{"world": 2, "hello": 1, "wonderful": 1}
```
<!-- needs more explanation and understanding -->
<!-- This code will print {"world": 2, "hello": 1, "wonderful": 1}. The or_insert method actually returns a mutable reference (&mut V) to the value for this key. Here we store that mutable reference in the count variable, so in order to assign to that value we must first dereference count using the asterisk (*). The mutable reference goes out of scope at the end of the for loop, so all of these changes are safe and allowed by the borrowing rules. -->

# Hashing Function

* HashMap uses a cryptographically secure hashing function that can provide 
  resistance to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

* If its slow, you can switch to another function by specifying a different hasher

* Provided by crates
