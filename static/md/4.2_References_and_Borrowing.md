# References and Borrowing

# References

Refer to some value with out taking ownership

* You pass references by appending with `&`

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1 = String::from("hello");
  let len = calculate_length(&s1); // dosen't pass the ownership only reference
  println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
  s.len()
}
```

class: left

# &ref

* arguments and parameters are prepended with `&`

* Since we don't have ownership

  * No need to return the values to give back ownership

  * Rust won't `drop` the value when the variable goes out of scope

---

class: left

# Mutable References

<!-- mutable reference is borrowing -->

* Like variables, references are also immutable by default

* Use `mut` to make it mutable

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut s = String::from("hello");

  change(&mut s);
}
fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
  some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

# The Rules of References

In a particular scope...

* One mutable reference, in a particular scope

  or

* Any number of immutable references.

  and

* Valid references

---

class: left

# One mutable reference

You can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a single scope

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s; //throws as error here...
```

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
{
    let r1 = &mut s;
} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.
let r2 = &mut s; // the previous mutable reference is already dropped
```

---

class: left

# Can't mix mutable and immutable references

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
```

<!-- * even in different scopes -->

# Data Race

A data race is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur...

* Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.

* At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.

* There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

Mutable references, with above characterestics prevents data race from happening

---

class: left

# Dangling References

* a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to
  someone else, by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory

  * Rust guarentees that the data will not go out of scope before the reference
    to the data does

```rust
fn main() {
  let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}
fn dangle() -> &String {
  let s = String::from("hello");
  &s
}
```

* s is created inside dangle and deallocated on `}`.
* But we tried to return a reference to it, which is pointing to an invalid String!
* Rust won’t let us do this.

# Dereferencing

* The opposite of referencing by using `&` is dereferencing

* * is the dereference operator

---

class: left

# Summary

* use **&** pass references to functions rather than giving ownership

* References are also immutable by default; use **mut** to make it mutable

* They has to be one mutable reference or can have multiple immutable references
  and they have be valid refernces

* This fixes data race conditions and dangling references

* You control the memory usage by using the ownership rules and Rust
  automatically clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope
