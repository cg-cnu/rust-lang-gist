# Validating References with Lifetimes

---

class: left

# Lifetimes

* reference has a lifetime, which is the scope for which that reference is valid

* Just like types, lifetimes are implicit and inferred

* Types are annotated, when they can't be infered or multiple types are possible

* Lifetimes are annotated, using generic lifetime parameters

* Rust’s most distinctive feature

# Lifetimes Prevent Dangling References

* Prevent dangling references, reference data other than the data we’re
  intending to reference

```rust
{
  let r;
  {
      let x = 5;
      r = &x;
  }
  println!("r: {}", r);
}
```

# The Borrow Checker

```rust
{
    let r;                // -------+-- 'a
                          //        |
    {                     //        |
        let x = 5;        // -+-----+-- 'b
        r = &x;           //  |     |
    }                     // -+     |
                          //        |
    println!("r: {}", r); //        |
}                         // -------+
```

* Errors because the lifetime 'b is shorter than the lifetime of 'a

* the subject of the reference does not live as long as the reference

```rust
fn main() {
  {
      let x = 5;            // -----+-- 'b
                            //      |
      let r = &x;           // --+--+-- 'a
                            //   |  |
      println!("r: {}", r); //   |  |
                            // --+  |
  }                         // -----+
}
```

A valid reference because the data has a longer lifetime than the reference

x has the lifetime 'b, which is larger than 'a, means r can reference x

Rust knows that the reference in r will always be valid while x is valid

# Lifetime Annotation Syntax

```rust
&i32        // a reference
&'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime
```

* Tells, how the generic lifetime parameters of multiple references relate to
  each other

# Lifetime Elision

* Initially all the lifetimes have to be explicitly mentioned

* Later programmed into the Rust core

* Follows a set of rules called `lifetime elision rules`

* The rules are a set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if
  your code fits these cases, you don’t need to write the lifetimes explicitly

* input lifetimes : Lifetimes on function or method parameters

* output lifetimes : lifetimes on return values

---

# Rules

* Each reference parameter gets its own lifetime parameter

  * a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter
    `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32)`

  * a function with two arguments gets two separate lifetime parameters
    `fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32)`

* If the number of input lifetime parameter is...

  * One : assign it to all output lifetime parameters 
          `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32`

  * multiple & one of them is &self or &mut self (method) :
                then the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all output lifetime 
                parameters.

# Example 1

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
```

* Rule 1 : Each parameter gets its own lifetime. We’re going to call it 'a 

```rust
fn first_word(s: &`a str) -> &str {
```

* Rule 2 :  All output lifetime parameters will get the single input life time 
            parameter 

```rust
fn first_word(s: &`a str) -> &`a str {
```

* Rule 3 : Dosen't apply since none of the parameters are self

---

class: left

# Example 2

```rust
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
```

* Rule 1 :  Each parameter gets its own lifetime, two parameters will have two 
            lifetimes

```rust
fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str {
```

* Rule 2 : Doesn’t apply since there is more than one input lifetime

* Rule 3 : Dosen't apply since it not a method and none of the parameters are self

Haven’t figured out what the return type’s lifetime is...

Compiler errors out, can't figure out the life time of the output parameter

# The Static Lifetime

* `'static` is a special lifetime 

* It is the entire duration of the program


```rust
let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
```

* The text of this string is stored directly in the binary of your program

* It is always available

* so, lifetime of all string literals is `'static`

# Generic Type Parameters, Trait Bounds, and Lifetimes Together

fn longest_with_an_announcement<'a, T>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str, ann: T) -> &'a str
    where T: Display
{
    println!("Announcement! {}", ann);
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
