# Defining Methods

Methods are similar to functions, except theyâ€™re defined within the 
context of a struct, enum or trait and their first parameter is always **&self**

* Declared with the `fn` keyword followed by name

* They can have parameters and a return value

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
  width: u32,
  height: u32,
}
impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
      self.width * self.height
  }
}
fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };
  println!(
      "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
      rect1.area()
  );
}
```

# Methods with more parameters

Methods can take multiple parameters that we add to the signature after the 
self parameter, and those parameters work just like parameters in functions.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
      self.width * self.height
  }

  fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
      self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
  }
}
```

# Associated functions

* Funcitons in `impl` block that dosen't take `&self` as parameter

* They are functions not methods as they don't have instance of struct

* Often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
      Rectangle { width: size, height: size }
  }
}
```

# Calling Associated Funciton

```rust
let sq = Rectangle::square(3);
```

* The funciton is namespace by the struct

* `::` is used for both Associated funcitons and the namespace created by modules

# Multiple `impl` Blocks

* Each struct is allowed to have multiple impl blocks

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
      self.width * self.height
  }
}

impl Rectangle {
  fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
      self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
  }
}
```

# Summary

* Methods are functions defined in a `impl` block with a default paramter `&self`

* They are invoked with `.` syntax

* Methods without default `&self` paramter are called Associated Functions

* They are invoked with `::` synxtax

* A struct can have multiple `impl` blocks
