# Defining Methods

Methods are similar to functions, except theyâ€™re defined within the context of
a struct, enum or trait and their first parameter is always **&self**

* Declared with the `fn` keyword followed by name

* They can have parameters and a return value

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
  width: u32,
  height: u32,
}
impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
      self.width * self.height
  }
}
fn main() {
  let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };
  println!(
      "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
      rect1.area()
  );
}
```

# Calling methods

* Methods can be called with `.` dot syntax

* `rect1.area()` will call the area method on the `rect1` struct

---

# Methods with more parameters

Methods can take multiple parameters that we add to the signature after the
self parameter, and those parameters work just like parameters in functions

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
      self.width * self.height
  }

  fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
      self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
  }
}
```

# Associated functions

Funcitons in `impl` block that dosen't take `&self` as parameter

* They are **functions not methods** as they don't have instance of struct

* Often used for constructors that will return a new instance of the struct

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
      Rectangle { width: size, height: size }
  }
}
```

---

class: left

# Calling Associated Funciton

```rust
let sq = Rectangle::square(3);
```

* The funciton is namespaced by the struct

* **::** is used for both Associated funcitons and the namespace created by
  modules

---

class: left

# Mutable self

* **&self** by default is a immutable reference

* **&mut self** will modify the object data in the method

* **self** will move the data to the method

---

class: left

# Multiple `impl` Blocks

Each struct is allowed to have multiple impl blocks

```rust
impl Rectangle {
  fn area(&self) -> u32 {
      self.width * self.height
  }
}

impl Rectangle {
  fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
      self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
  }
}
```

# Summary

* Methods are functions defined in a **impl** block with a default parameter **&self**

* A struct can have multiple **impl** blocks

* If the parameter contains...

  * **&self** : method can use the values of the struct, but not change them

  * **&mut self** : method can modify the values

  * **self** : method will consume the value, which will move

  * **no self** : called Associate Functions, used as "constructor"

* If `&self` they are invoked with `.`

* If no `self` they are invoked with `::`
