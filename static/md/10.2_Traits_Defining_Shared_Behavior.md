# Traits: Defining Shared Behavior

* Abstract over behavior that types can have in common

* Trait tells the Rust compiler about functionality a particular type has and
  might share with other types

* Traits are ways to add special behaviour to objects even though the objects
  are not yours

* When using generic type parameters, we can use trait bounds to specify, at compile time, that the generic type may be any type that implements a trait and therefore has the behavior we want to use in that situation

* Traits are similar to a feature often called ‘interfaces’ in other languages, though with some differences

---

class: left

# Defining a Trait

* The behavior of a type consists of the methods we can call on that type

* Different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types

# Default Implementations

```rust
pub trait Summarizable {
    fn summary(&self) -> String {
        String::from("(Read more...)")
    }
}
```

Definition of `Summarizable` `trait` with a default implementation of the summary method

```rust
impl Summarizable for NewsArticle {}
```

Use the default implementation

```rust
let article = NewsArticle {
    headline: String::from("Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!"),
    location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
    author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
    content: String::from("The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best
    hockey team in the NHL."),
};
println!("New article available! {}", article.summary());
```

This code prints New article available! (Read more...).

* Reusing the implementation from the default summarizable trait

* To override the default, just implement the trait method

---

class: left

# Default Implementations calling other methods

* Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait

* even if those other methods don’t have a default implementation

```rust
pub trait Summarizable {
    fn author_summary(&self) -> String;
    fn summary(&self) -> String {
        format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.author_summary())
    }
}
```

author_summary is being called by summary, but there is no default implementation

For a type to use the summarizable trait,

* it may or may not implement `summary`, as there is a default implementation

* has to implement the `author_summary` as there is no default implementation

---

class: left

```rust
// defining author_summary as there is no default implementation
impl Summarizable for Tweet {
    fn author_summary(&self) -> String {
        format!("@{}", self.username)
    }
}
let tweet = Tweet {
    username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
    content: String::from("of course, as you probably already know, people"),
    reply: false,
    retweet: false,
};
// now you can call the tweet summary
println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summary());
```

```rust
1 new tweet: (Read more from @horse_ebooks...)
```
