# `if` Expressions

An if expression allows us to branch our code depending on conditions

```rust
fn main() {
  let number = 3;
  if number < 5 {
      println!("condition was true");
  }
}
```

* Starts with `if` keyword

* Follwed by condition, which should evaluate to boolean

* Rust won't convert non boolean types to booleans

* Block of code in `{}` called **arms** is executed based on condition

# `else` expression

evalutes if the **if expression** condition is false

```rust
  if number < 5 {
      println!("condition was true");
  } else {
      println!("condition was false");
  }
```

---

class: left

# `else if` expression

Multiple conditions with **else if**

```rust
  if number = 5 {
      println!("number is 5");
  } else if number < 5  {
      println!("condition was true");
  } else {
      println!("condition was false");
  }
```

# Using `if` in a `let` statement

We can use if in a statement and assign the value to a variable

```rust
let number = if condition {
  5
} else {
  6
};
```

Arms of the if expressions should be of the same type

```rust
let number = if condition {
  5 // integer
} else {
  "six" // string literal
}
```

An `if` without an `else` always returns an empty tuple `()`

# Repetition with Loops

* Execute a block of code more than once

* They are three types...**loop**, **while** and **for**

---

class: left

# Loop

* Execute a block of code over and over, until you explicitly tell it to stop

```rust
fn main() {
  loop {
      println!("again!");
  }
}
```

Cancel with

* `ctrl+c`

or

* `break` keyword for stopping gracefully

---

class: left

# While

* Execute a block of code while a condition holds true

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut number = 3;

  while number != 0 {
      println!("{}!", number);

      number = number - 1;
  }

  println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

---

class: left

# For

Loop over the elements of a collection, such as

* an array

  ```rust
  fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
  }
  ```

* a range

  ```rust
  fn main() {
    for number in (1..4) {
        println!("{}!", number);
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
  }
  ```

# Summary

* **if** and **else if** expression should have condition which evaluates to
  boolean

* Blocks of code in `{}` called **arms** are executed based on the condition
  value and all the arms should be of same type

* **if** can be used in a statement and assigned to a variable

* **loop** executes for ever, untill **break** statement

* **while** executes untill the condition is true

* **for** executes for each element in the collection
