# Strings Store UTF-8 Encoded Text

Strings are implemented as a collection of bytes plus some methods to provide 
useful functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text

Strings are difficult because...

  * Rust’s propensity for exposing possible errors

  * strings being a more complicated data structure
    
  * UTF-8

---
class: left

# str

* The core of Rust implements `str`

* Generally seen in it's borrowd form `&str`

* These are called *string slices*

* String literals are stored in the binary output of the program and are 
  therefore string slices

---
class: left

# String

* String type is provided in Rust standard library

* Is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type

---
class: left

# String vs str

* 'String' is a string buffer and `&str` is a view into string buffer

* “strings” mean the `String` and the string slice `&str` types
  not just one of those types

* Both String and &str are UTF-8 encoded

* Std Lib also includes a number of other string types, such as
  OsString, OsStr, CString, and CStr

* Libraries can provide even more options

# Creating a New String

```rust
let mut s = String::new();
```

Create a new empty string `s` that we can load data into

```rust
let data = "initial contents";
let s = data.to_string();
// the method also works on a literal directly
let s = "initial contents".to_string();
```
create a string literal and then convert that to String 

```rust
let s = String::from("initial contents");
```
Create a String from string literal directly

---
class: left

# UTF-8 encoded

* Strings are UTF-8 encoded

* We can include any properly encoded data in them

```rust
let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
let hello = String::from("Hello");
let hello = String::from("שָׁלוֹם");
let hello = String::from("नमस्ते");
let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
let hello = String::from("你好");
let hello = String::from("Olá");
let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
let hello = String::from("Hola");
```

---
class: left

# Updating a String

A string can 

  * Grow in size

  * Contents can change

Use `+` or the `format!` macro to concatenate string values together

---
class: left

# Appending to a String with `push_str`

```rust
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");
```

```rust
let mut s1 = String::from("foo");
let s2 = "bar";
s1.push_str(&s2);
println!("s2 is {}", s2);
```

`push_str` method ...

* Takes a string slice as parameter

* Dosen't take ownership of the argument it gets

* Adds the string slice to the existing string

---
class: left

# Appending to a String with `push`

```rust
let mut s = String::from("lo");
s.push('l');
```
`push` method ...

* Takes a character as a parameter 

* Dosen't take ownership of the argument

* Dosen't accept references

* and adds the character to the String

---
class: left

# Concatenation with the + Operator 

```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // Note that s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
```

* `+` is a generic and we can add only a `&str` to `String`

---
class: left

# `+` implementation

* looks someting like this...

```rust
fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {
```

* We can't add two `String` values 

* Add `&Str` to `String`

* But, wait, the type of `&s2` is `String` not `Str` ?

* Rust uses a *deref coercion*, which here turns &s2 into &s2[..]

---
class: left

# Ownership

`let s3 = s1 + &s2;` 

* Take ownership of s1

* Appends a copy of the contents of s2

* S2 is still valid, no ownership taken

* Returns ownership of the result

---
class: left

# Concatenating multiple strings

```rust
let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");

let s = s1 + "-" + &s2 + "-" + &s3;
```

---
class: left

# Concatenation with the format! Macro 

```rust
let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");

let s = format!("{}-{}-{}", s1, s2, s3);
```

* `format!` work like `println!` but returns the string

* Dosen't take ownership of any parameters

---
class: left

# Indexing into Strings

* Strings don’t support indexing

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let h = s1[0];
```

```rust
error[E0277]: the trait bound `std::string::String: std::ops::Index<{integer}>` is not satisfied
 -->
  |
3 |     let h = s1[0];
  |             ^^^^^ the type `std::string::String` cannot be indexed by `{integer}`
  |
  = help: the trait `std::ops::Index<{integer}>` is not implemented for `std::string::String`
```

# Why not?

accessing individual characters in a string by referencing them by index is a 
valid and common operation in many programmig languages

# Internal Representation

`String` is a wrapper over a `Vec<u8>`
  
```rust
let len = String::from("Hola").len(); // 4
```

Vec storing the string “Hola” is four bytes long

```rust
let len = String::from("Здравствуйте").len(); // 24 ?
```

Vec storing the string “Здравствуйте” is 24 bytes long rathern than 12

Why ?

  * Because each Unicode scalar value takes two bytes of storage

So, an index into the string’s bytes will not always correlate to a valid 
Unicode scalar value

# Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My!

Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data

Hindi word “नमस्ते” written in the Devanagari script is ultimately stored as 

* a **Vec of u8** values that looks like this

```rust
[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,
224, 165, 135]
```

* **Unicode Scalar Values** 

```rust
['न', 'म', 'स',  '्', 'त',  'े']
```

* There are 6 characters

* 4 and 6 are diacritics which don't make sense on their own

---
class: left

* **grapheme clusters** 

```rust
["न", "म", "स्", "ते"]
```

This four letters that make up the Hindi word

---
class: left

# Indexing is a bad idea 

because...

* it’s not clear the return type would be: a byte value, a character, a grapheme
  cluster, or a string slice. 

* Indexing operations are expected to always take constant time (O(1)), but not 
  possible to guarantee

---
class: left

# Slicing Strings

Rather than indexing using [] with a single number, you can use [] with a range 
to create a string slice containing particular bytes

```rust
let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let s = &hello[0..4];
```

`s` will be a `&str` that contains the first four bytes of the string, `Зд`

```rust
let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let s = &hello[0..1];
```

Rust will panic at runtime in the same way that accessing an invalid index in 
a vector does

create string slices with caution, it can crash your program

# Methods for Iterating Over Strings

* `chars`

```rust
for c in "नमस्ते".chars() {
  println!("{}", c);
}
```

```rust
न
म
स
्
त
े
```

---
class: left

* `bytes`

```rust
for b in "नमस्ते".bytes() {
  println!("{}", b);
}
```

```rust
224
164
168
224
// ... etc
```

Remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of more than one byte

* `grapheme clusters`

functionality is not provided by the standard library, crates are available

# Summary

* Strings Are Not So Simple

* “strings” include `String` type and the string slice `&str` 

* They are `UTF-8` encoded

* Update the string with `push_str` or add a character with `push`

* Concatenate strings with `+` or `format`

* Can't safely index into the strings, you can use slicing with caution
