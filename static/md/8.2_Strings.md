# Strings Store UTF-8 Encoded Text

Strings are implemented as a collection of bytes plus some methods to provide
useful functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text

Strings are difficult because...

* Rust’s propensity for exposing possible errors

* strings being a more complicated data structure

* UTF-8

---

class: left

# str

* The core of Rust implements `str`

* Generally seen in it's borrowd form `&str`

* These are called **string slices**

* **String literals** are stored in the binary output of the program and are
  therefore string slices

---

class: left

# String

* String type is provided in Rust standard library

* Is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type

---

class: left

# String vs str

* 'String' is a string buffer and `&str` is a view into string buffer

* “strings” mean the `String` and the string slice `&str` types
  not just one of those types

* Both String and &str are UTF-8 encoded

* Std Lib also includes a number of other string types, such as
  OsString, OsStr, CString, and CStr

* Libraries can provide even more options

---

class: left

# Creating a New String

```rust
let mut s = String::new();
```

Create a new empty string `s` that we can load data into

```rust
let data = "initial contents";
let s = data.to_string();
// the method also works on a literal directly
let s = "initial contents".to_string();
```

create a string literal and then convert that to String

```rust
let s = String::from("initial contents");
```

Create a String from string literal directly

---

class: left

# UTF-8 encoded

* Strings are UTF-8 encoded

* We can include any properly encoded data in them

```rust
let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
let hello = String::from("Hello");
let hello = String::from("שָׁלוֹם");
let hello = String::from("नमस्ते");
let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
let hello = String::from("你好");
let hello = String::from("Olá");
let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
let hello = String::from("Hola");
```

---

class: left

# Updating a String

A string can

* Grow in size

* Contents can change

Use `+` or the `format!` macro to concatenate string values together

---

class: left

# Appending to a String with `push_str`

```rust
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");
```

```rust
let mut s1 = String::from("foo");
let s2 = "bar";
s1.push_str(&s2);
println!("s2 is {}", s2);
```

`push_str` method ...

* Takes a string slice as parameter

* Dosen't take ownership of the argument

* Adds the string slice to the existing String

---

class: left

# Appending to a String with `push`

```rust
let mut s = String::from("lo");
s.push('l');
```

`push` method ...

* Takes a character as parameter

* Dosen't take ownership of the argument

* Dosen't accept references

* Adds the character to the end of String

---

class: left

# Concatenation with the + Operator

```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // Note that s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
```

---

class: left

# `+` implementation

* looks someting like this...

  ```rust
  fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {
  ```

* `+` is a generic and we can add only a `&str` to `String`

* We can't add two `String` values

* But, wait, the type of `&s2` is `String` not `Str` ?

* Rust uses a _deref coercion_, which here turns &s2 into &s2[..]

---

class: left

# Ownership

```rust
let s3 = s1 + &s2;
```

* `+` takes ownership of s1

* Appends a copy of the contents of s2

* S2 is still valid, no ownership taken

* Returns ownership of the result

---

class: left

# Concatenating with `+`

```rust
let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");

let s = s1 + "-" + &s2 + "-" + &s3;
```

---

class: left

# Concatenation with `format!`

```rust
let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");

let s = format!("{}-{}-{}", s1, s2, s3);
```

* `format!` work like `println!` but returns the string

* Dosen't take ownership of any parameters

---

class: left

# Indexing into Strings

* Strings don’t support indexing

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let h = s1[0];
```

```rust
error[E0277]: the trait bound `std::string::String: std::ops::Index<{integer}>` is not satisfied
 -->
  |
3 |     let h = s1[0];
  |             ^^^^^ the type `std::string::String` cannot be indexed by `{integer}`
  |
  = help: the trait `std::ops::Index<{integer}>` is not implemented for `std::string::String`
```

class: left

# Why not?

Accessing individual characters in a string by referencing them by index is a
valid and common operation in many programmig languages

---

class: left

# Internal Representation

`String` is a wrapper over a `Vec<u8>`

```rust
let len = String::from("Hola").len(); // 4
```

Vec storing the string “Hola” is four bytes long

```rust
let len = String::from("Здравствуйте").len(); // 24 ?
```

Vec storing the string “Здравствуйте” is 24 bytes long rathern than 12

Why ?

Because each Unicode scalar value takes two bytes of storage

So, an index into the string’s bytes will not always correlate to a valid
Unicode scalar value

# Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My!

Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data

* Bytes

* Unicode Scalar Value

* Grapheme Clusters

Hindi word “नमस्ते” written in the Devanagari script is ultimately stored as...

---

class: left

# Bytes

* A **Vec of u8** values that looks like this

```rust
[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,
224, 165, 135]
```

---

class: left

# **Unicode Scalar Values**

```rust
['न', 'म', 'स',  '्', 'त',  'े']
```

* There are 6 characters

* 4 and 6 are diacritics which don't make sense on their own

---

class: left

# **grapheme clusters**

```rust
["न", "म", "स्", "ते"]
```

This four letters that make up the Hindi word

---

class: left

# Indexing is a bad idea

because...

* it’s not clear the return type would be: a byte value, a character, a grapheme
  cluster, or a string slice.

* Indexing operations are expected to always take constant time (O(1)), but not
  possible to guarantee

---

class: left

# Slicing Strings

Rather than indexing using `[]` with a single number

Use `[]` with a range to create a string slice containing particular bytes

```rust
let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let s = &hello[0..4];
```

`s` will be a `&str` that contains the first four bytes of the string, `Зд`

```rust
let hello = "Здравствуйте";
let s = &hello[0..1];
```

* Will panic at runtime in the same way accessing an invalid index in a vector does

* create string slices with caution, it can crash your program

# Methods for Iterating Over Strings

### `chars`

```rust
for c in "नमस्ते".chars() {
  println!("{}", c);
}
```

```rust
न
म
स
्
त
े
```

---

class: left

### `bytes`

```rust
for b in "नमस्ते".bytes() {
  println!("{}", b);
}
```

```rust
224
164
168
224
// ... etc
```

Remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of more than one byte

* `grapheme clusters`

functionality is not provided by the standard library, crates are available

# Summary

* Strings Are Not So Simple

* “strings” include `String` type and the string slice `&str`

* They are `UTF-8` encoded

* Update the string with `push_str` or add a character with `push`

* Concatenate strings with `+` or `format`

* Can't safely index into the strings, you can use slicing with caution
