# `panic!` macro

Rust provides `panic!` macro for case of critical failures...

`Panic!` macro will...

  * print a failure message

  * unwind and clean up the stack or abort

  * and then quit.

# Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a panic!

* Unwinding 

  * Rust walks back the stack and clean up the data from each funciton 

  * Take a lot of work and resulting binary will be large

* Unwinding 

  * Ends the program with out cleanup and OS will clean the data 

  * Process will end quickly and the resulting binary will be small

# Config

Add `panic = 'abort'` to the appropirate profile 

```TOML
[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
```

If you want to abort on panic in release mode

# `panic!` intentionally 

```rust
fn main() {
  panic!("crash and burn");
}
```

```rust
$ cargo run
Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25 secs
Running `target/debug/panic`
thread 'main' panicked at 'crash and burn', src/main.rs:2:4
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
```

# `panic!` caused by an issue

```rust
fn main() {
  let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

  v[99];
}
```

```rust
$ cargo run
   Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.27 secs
     Running `target/debug/panic`
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is
99', /checkout/src/liballoc/vec.rs:1555:10
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
error: Process didn't exit successfully: `target/debug/panic` (exit code: 101)
```

Attempting to access an element beyond the end of a vector, which will cause a panic!

# Using a panic! Backtrace

* A backtrace is a list of all the functions that have been called to get to 
  this point

* set the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to get a backtrace of exactly 
  what happened to cause the error.

* The key to reading the backtrace is to start from the top and read until 
  you see files you wrote

* To get backtraces, debug symbols must be enabled. 

* They are enabled by default when using cargo build or cargo run without the 
  --release flag

# Summary

* `panic!` prints a failure message and unwinds, cleanup or abort and then quit

* Choose to cleanup or abort by setting `panic = 'abort'` in Cargo.toml 

* A backtrace is a list of all the functions that have been called to get to this point

* Set `RUST_BACKTRACE` env variable to get a backtrace
