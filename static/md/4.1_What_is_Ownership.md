# Ownership

class: left

# Memory

* A Part of memory is available to your code to use at runtime

* They are structured in two ways

  * stack

  * heap

---

class: left

# Stack

* Stack stores values in the order it gets and removes it in the opposite order

* This is referred to as, last in first out (LIFO)

* All data should take fixed size

* The size of the data is known at compile time

* Adding data is called `push`ing onto the stack

* Removing data is called `pop`ping off the stack

* Fast, because of the way it accesses data

---

class: left

# Heap

* On requesting, OS will find a space, mark it as used and then returns the
  address

* Address is the **Pointer**

* Heap is less organized

* Data can be of varied sizes

* Large data takes more time to allocate

* Process of allocating memory is called `allocation on the heap` or simply
  `allocation`

* Slow, because we have to follow a pointer to access memory

---

class: left

# Memory Management

Different styles of memory management...

* **Garbage collection**, a program that constantly looks for unused memory and
  cleans at run-time

* **Manual**, programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory

* **ownership rules** Follow a set of rules, that the compiler checks at compile
  time with no run-time cost

Rust falls under the third category

---

class: left

# Ownership

Ownership defines a set of rules which takes care of...

  * Keeping track of what parts of code is using what data on the heap

  * Minimizing the amount of duplicate data

  * Cleaning up unused data

No need to think of stack and heap once you start following ownership rules

---

class: left

# Ownership Rules

* Each value in Rust has a variable, that’s called its **owner**

* There can only be **one owner at a time**

* When the owner goes **out of scope**, the value will be **dropped**

---

class: left

# Variable Scope

A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid

Rust is a block scoped language and is delimited by **{ }**

```rust
{
  // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
  // s is valid from this point forward
  let s = "hello";
  // do stuff with s
} // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
// throws an error, s is no longer available
println!("{}", s)
```

Important points in time...

* When `s` comes into scope, it is valid

* It remains so until it goes out of scope

---

class: left

# String vs str (string literal)

```rust
let a = "str";
```

* str (string literal) - Text is hardcoded directly into the final executable

  * Fast and efficient to access

  * Size and contents known at compile time

  * Immutable

```rust
let a = String::from("string");
```

* String - Allocated during run time

  * Written to heap, slow to allocate and access

  * Size and contents are not known at compile time

  * Mutable and Growable

---

class: left

# Memory and Allocation

```rust
{
  // s is valid from this point forward
  let s = String::from("hello");
  // do stuff with s
} // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

* Memory allocated in heap at runtime

* Memory is automatically freed once the variable that owns it goes out of scope

* Rust calls a special function `drop` automatically at the closing `}`

---

class: left

# Ways Variables and Data Interact

Variables and data interact in three ways...

  * Move

  * Clone

  * Copy

---

class: left

## Move

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
```

Allocate the heap for `hello` and push onto stack for the pointer, length and
capacity with variable s1

<img src="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/img/trpl04-01.svg" width="400"/>

---

class: left

```rust
let s2 = s1;
```

Copy the stack memory to the new variable s2

<img src="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/img/trpl04-02.svg" width="400"/>

---

class: left

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;

println!("{}, world!", s1);
```

Invalidate s1 as both of them are pointing to the same heap because rust can't
decide which one to drop at the end of the scope

```rust
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `s1`
 --> src/main.rs:5:28
  |
3 |     let s2 = s1;
  |         -- value moved here
4 |
5 |     println!("{}, world!", s1);
  |                            ^^ value used here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `s1` has type `std::string::String`, which does
  not implement the `Copy` trait
```

Throws an error if you try to access after the assignement

---

class: left

## Clone

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

* Allocate the heap for `hello` and push onto stack for the pointer, length and
  capacity with variable s1

* Clone the stack memory and heap memory for the new variable s2

---

class: left

## Copy

Happens for Stack-only data

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;
```

* Bind the value 5 to x and copy the value of x and bind it to y

* Not a move operation because, 5 is an integer of known size and allocated in stack

* There is no difference between deep and shallow copy, in this case

* Any group of simple scalar types can be Copy

* Tuples also, but only if they contain types that are also Copy,
  (i32, i32) is Copy, but (i32, String) is not

# Ownership and Functions

Passing a variable to a function will `move` or `copy`, just like assignment
based on the type

```rust
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope.
  takes_ownership(s); // s's value moves into the function...
                      // ... and so is no longer valid here.
  let x = 5;          // x comes into scope.
  makes_copy(x);      // x would move into the function,
                      // but i32 is Copy, so it’s okay to still
                      // use x afterward.
} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s.
// But since s's value was moved, nothing
// special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
  println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
// memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope.
  println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

# Return Values and Scope

Returning a variable from a function will `move` or `copy` based on the type

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = gives_ownership();         // gives_ownership moves its return
                                        // value into s1.
    let s2 = String::from("hello");     // s2 comes into scope.
    let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);  // s2 is moved into
                                        // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                        // moves its return value into s3.
} // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 goes out of scope but was
  // moved, so nothing happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.
fn gives_ownership() -> String {             // gives_ownership will move its
                                             // return value into the function
                                             // that calls it.
    let some_string = String::from("hello"); // some_string comes into scope.
    some_string                              // some_string is returned and
                                             // moves out to the calling
                                             // function.
}
// takes_and_gives_back will take a String and return one.
fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String { // a_string comes into
                                                      // scope.
    a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function.
}
```

# Passing ownership back to main function

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len);
}
fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
    let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String.
    (s, length)
}
```

* Passing an argument is giving ownership

* Return the value to give back the ownership else parent scope won't have value

* Tedious to tranfer back all the time, use **borrowing**

# Summary

* Memory will be organized in **stack** and **heap**

* Memory management is done by **garbage collection**, **manual** or **ownership rules**

* Rust uses Ownership rules

* Each value will have one owner and its dropped if the owner goes out of scope

* Variable scope is limited to the block defined in the {}

* Variables and data intereact by **move**, **clone** and **copy** operations

* Passing a variable and returning a variable in a function, will move or copy
  based on the type
