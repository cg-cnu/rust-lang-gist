# Box<T>

class: left

# Box<T>

* Box<T> Points to Data on the Heap and Has a Known Size

* Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack

* What remains on the stack is the pointer to the heap data

* No performance overhead other than storing data on the heap

* No additional capabilities

---

class: left

# Use Cases 

* When you have a type whose size can’t be known at compile time, and you want 
  to use a value of that type in a context that needs to know an exact size

* When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but 
  ensure the data won’t be copied when you do so

* When you want to own a value and only care that it’s a type that implements a 
  particular trait rather than knowing the concrete type

# Using a Box<T> to Store Data on the Heap

```rust
fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("b = {}", b);
}
```
```rust
b = 5;
```

* We define the variable `b` to have the value of a Box that points to the 
  value 5, which is allocated on the heap


* We can access the data in the box in a similar way as we would if this data 
  was on the stack

* Just like any owned value, when a box goes out of scope like b does at the end of main, it will be deallocated

* The deallocation happens for the box (stored on the stack) and the data it points to (stored on the heap)

# Recursive Types

* Where a value can have as part of itself another value of the same type

* size can’t be known at compile time 

---

class: left

# Boxes Enable Recursive Types

* At compile time, Rust needs to know how much space a type takes up.

* In Recursive Types, nesting of values could theoretically continue infinitely,
  Rust doesn’t know how much space a value of a recursive type needs

* Boxes have a known size, so by inserting a box in a recursive type definition, we can have recursive types

* Boxes let us define a recursive data type without much distraction

# The Cons List

* A `cons` list is a data structure that comes from the Lisp programming language 
  and its dialects

* In Lisp, the `cons` function (short for “construct function”) constructs a new
  pair from its two arguments, which usually are a single value and another 
  pair. These pairs containing pairs form a list.

* The cons function concept has made its way into more general functional 
  programming jargon: “to cons x onto y” informally means to construct a new 
  container instance by putting the element x at the start of this new 
  container, followed by the container y.

* Not a commonly used data structure in Rust, unlike other functional language

* Vec<T> is a better choice to use, for list of items

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, List),
    Nil,
}
```
