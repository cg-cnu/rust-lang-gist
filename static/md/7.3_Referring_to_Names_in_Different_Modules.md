# Referring to Names in Different Modules

# Calling a function in module

```rust
pub mod a {
  pub mod series {
      pub mod of {
          pub fn nested_modules() {}
      }
  }
}

fn main() {
  a::series::of::nested_modules();
}
```

- Call function by fully specifying its enclosing module’s path joined by **::**

- Someties referring to the fully qualified name can get quite lengthy

---

class: left

# Bringing Names into Scope

```rust
pub mod a {
  pub mod series {
      pub mod of {
          pub fn nested_modules() {}
      }
  }
}

use a::series::of;

fn main() {
  of::nested_modules();
}
```

- **use** keyword follwed by the enclosing module’s path brings the module into
  scope

- It dosen't bring the childrens of module into scope

---

class: left

# Bringing functions into Scope

You can also directly bring a function into the scope with `use`

```rust
pub mod a {
  pub mod series {
      pub mod of {
          pub fn nested_modules() {}
      }
  }
}

use a::series::of::nested_modules;

fn main() {
  nested_modules();
}
```

This exclude all the modules and reference the function directly

---

class: left

# Bringing `enums` into Scope

Because enums also form a sort of namespace like modules, we can bring an enum’s
variants into scope with `use`

```rust
enum TrafficLight {
  Red,
  Yellow,
  Green,
}

use TrafficLight::{Red, Yellow};

fn main() {
  let red = Red;
  let yellow = Yellow;
  let green = TrafficLight::Green;
}
```

- if bringing multiple items from one namespace into scope, you can list them
  using curly brackets and commas in the last position

- Still specifying the TrafficLight namespace for the Green variant because we
  didn’t include Green in the use statement

---

class: left

# Bringing All Names into Scope with a Glob

Bring all the items in a namespace into scope at once using `*`

```rust
enum TrafficLight {
  Red,
  Yellow,
  Green,
}
use TrafficLight::*;
fn main() {
  let red = Red;
  let yellow = Yellow;
  let green = Green;
}
```

use globs sparingly, they might cause naming conflicts

---

class: left

# Using super to Access a Parent Module

Access root of the module using the **::** at the start

```rust
::client::connect();
```

Access parent of the current module using **super::**

```rust
super::client::connect();
```

---

class: left

# Root `::` vs Super `super::`

When compared with using the root `::`

- Super is helpful incase of deep modules

- Super won't break the modules even if they are rearranged

# Summary

- You call a function in side a module with fully qualified name
  `a::series::of::nested_modules();`

- **use** keyword follwed by the enclosing module’s path brings the module into
  scope

- Bring all the items in a namespace into scope at once using glob `*`

- **::** at the begining of the path lets you access the root of the module

- **super::** lets you access the parent directory
