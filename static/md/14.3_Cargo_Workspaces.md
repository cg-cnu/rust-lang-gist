# Workspaces

* `workspaces` help manage multiple related packages, developed in tandem

* workspace is a set of packages that share the same Cargo.lock and output directory

* There are multiple ways to structure a workspace and the common way is...

```bash
$ mkdir add
$ cd add
```

---

class: left

* Create a directory for the workspace 

* Create a Cargo.toml file that configures the entire workspace. 

* It won’t have a `[package]` section or any metadata

* It starts with a `[workspace]` section and add a member to the workspace path adder, 
  which is where we’ll put our binary crate

```toml
[workspace]

members = [
    "adder",
]
```

Create adder binary by running...

```bash
$ cargo new --bin adder
     Created binary (application) `adder` project
```

```bash
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target
```

* The entire workspace has one target directory at the top level

* The adder crate doesn’t have its own target directory

* Running `cargo build` will create binary only in the outer `target` folder

# Creating the Second Crate in the Workspace

```toml
[workspace]

members = [
    "adder",
    "add-one",
]
```

```bash
$ cargo new add-one
     Created library `add-one` project
```

Will create a new library named `add-one`

```bash
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── add-one
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── lib.rs
├── adder
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs
└── target
```

# Dependencies


in adder/Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
add-one = { path = "../add-one" }
```

Add add-one as dependcy inside adder

# Building and Running

* You can build the workspace by running `cargo build`

* You can choose to run the package by running `cargo run -p <packageName>`

---

class: left

# Depending on an External Crate in a Workspace

* `Cargo.lock` is at the top of the workspace

* Adding external crates to any of the `Cargo.toml` files will update the global
  'Cargo.lock' 

This will ensure that...

  * Won't download twice

  * All the crates are using the save version of dependencies

  * Crates in the workspace are compatible with each other

---

class: left

# Adding a Test to a Workspace

* `cargo test` will run `tests` and `documentation tests` in all the packages

* `cargo test -p <packageName>` will run tests for just that package

---

class: left

# Publishing the crates in the workspace

* Each `crate` in the workspace has to be published separately

* change to each crate’s directory in the workspace and run `cargo publish`

# Summary

* `workspace` is a set of packages that share the same Cargo.lock and output 
  directory

* Add memebers in the `cargo.toml` by adding `members = ['packageA', 'packageB']`

* Each package will have its own `Cargo.toml` file

* Single `Cargo.lock` file at the root will ensure all the crates are using the
  same external crates

* 

* `cargo build` will build all packages `crargo buidl -p <package>` will build 
  single package

* `cargo test` will run tests for all packages `cargo test -p <package>` will limit 
  to one package

* Publish packages by change to each crate’s directory and run `cargo publish`

* Keeping crates in a workspace makes coordination between them easier if they 
  often change at the same time
