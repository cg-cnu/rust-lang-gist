# Message Passing to Transfer Data Between Threads

# Message Passing

* Increasingly popular approach to safe concurrency

* Where threads or actors communicate by sending each other messages containing 
  data

> Do not communicate by sharing memory; instead, share memory by communicating.
  --Effective Go

# Channel

* One major tool for sending messages across threads

* Provided by Rust's standard library

Channel has two halves...

* **transmitter :** Code calls the method with data we want to send

* **receiver :** Code calls the method with receiving end for arriving messages

* A channel is said to be closed if either the transmitter or receiver half is 
  dropped

# Creating Channel

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
}
```

* Create new channel using the `mpsc::channel` function

* `mpsc` stands for `multiple producer, single consumer`

* Means a channel can have multiple sending ends that produce values but only 
  one receiving end that consumes those values

* `mpsc::channel` returns a tuple, the first element of which is the sending end
  and the second element is the receiving end

* Represented as `tx` for transmitter and `rx` for receiver

* Create a channel but not do anything with it 

* This won’t compile yet because Rust can’t tell what type of values we want 
  to send over the channel

# Sending Message

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from("hi");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });
}
```

Move the transmitting end into a spawned thread and have it send one string so 
the spawned thread is communicating with the main thread

* `thread::spawn` to creates a new thread

* Using `move` to move `tx` into the closure so the spawned thread owns `tx`

* The send method returns a `Result<T, E>` type 

* Will return an error if...
  
  * the receiving end has already been dropped and 
  
  * there’s nowhere to send a value 

* Call `unwrap` to panic in case of an error

# Receiving Message

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from("hi");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
    });
    let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!("Got: {}", received);
}
```

* The receiving end of a channel has two useful methods: 

  * **recv :** 

    * short for receive
    
    * Will block the main thread’s execution and wait until a value is sent 
      down the channel

    * On receiving a value, `recv` will return it in a Result<T, E>

    * When the sending end of the channel closes, recv will return an error to 
      signal that no more values will be coming
  
  * **try_recv :**

    * Won't block the main thread

    * Return a Result<T, E> immediately, 

      * **Ok** value holding a message if one is available 
      
      * **Err** value if there aren’t any messages this time

    * Useful if this thread has other work to do while waiting for messages

    * Write a loop that calls try_recv every so often, handles a message if one 
      is available, and otherwise does other work for a little while until 
      checking again

# Channels and Ownership Transference

* Ownership rules play a vital role in message sending because they help us 
  write safe, concurrent code

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let val = String::from("hi");
        tx.send(val).unwrap();
        println!("val is {}", val);
    });
    let received = rx.recv().unwrap();
    println!("Got: {}", received);
}
```
```rust
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `val`
  --> src/main.rs:10:31
   |
9  |         tx.send(val).unwrap();
   |                 --- value moved here
10 |         println!("val is {}", val);
   |                               ^^^ value used here after move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `val` has type `std::string::String`, which does
not implement the `Copy` trait
```

`Send` function takes ownership of its parameter, and when the value is moved, 
the receiver takes ownership of it. 

This stops us from accidentally using the value again after sending it; the 
ownership system checks that everything is okay

# Sending Multiple Values and Seeing the Receiver Waiting

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let vals = vec![
            String::from("hi"),
            String::from("from"),
            String::from("the"),
            String::from("thread"),
        ];
        for val in vals {
            tx.send(val).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        }
    });
    for received in rx {
        println!("Got: {}", received);
    }
}
```

```text
Got: hi
Got: from
Got: the
Got: thread
```

Because we don’t have any code that pauses or delays in the for loop in the main 
thread, we can tell that the main thread is waiting to receive values from the
spawned thread
