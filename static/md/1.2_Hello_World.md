# Hello, World!

---

class: left

# First program

Create folders

```bash
$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
```

In **main.rs** write...

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Execute

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```

# Anatomy of a Rust Program

```rust
fn main() {

}
```

* `fn` defines a function

* `main` function inside **main.rs** is the first code that is run

* Parameters are provided inside `()`

* Function body is wrapped in `{}`

---

class: left

# Anatomy of a Rust Program

```rust
println!("Hello, world!");
```

* `println!` prints text to screen

* `!` indicates that `println!` is a macro

* `"Hello, World!"` is a string literal

* Line ends with a semicolon `;`

# Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps

Rust is a ahead of time compiled language

To compile the program...

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
```

To run the program...

```bash
$ ./main
```

# Hello, Cargo!

* Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager

* Cargo takes care of

  * Creating projects

  * Building your code

  * Downloading the libraries your code depends on and building those libraries

* Installed along with Rust

  ```bash
  $ cargo --version
  ```

* Libraries or packages of Rust code are called **crates**

---

class: left

# Creating a project

```bash
$ cargo new hello_cargo --bin
```

**--bin** : Will create an executable application

**--lib** : Will create a library

**convention :** Use snake_case for crate names

---

class: left

# Folder structure

```bash
|--- src/main.rs
|--- Cargo.toml
|--- .gitignore
```

* All the source code lives inside the `src` folder

  * `main.rs` will have a **hello world** example

    ```rust
    fn main() {
      println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    ```

* `Cargo.toml` contains the configuration

* Cargo by default initializes **git** as VCS and adds **.gitignore**

  * Change it by using the **--vcs** flag

---

class: left

# Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

[dependencies]
```

* **TOML** is used as Cargo’s configuration format

* **[package]** lists the name, version, author and other package **metadata**

* **[dependencies]** list all the other **crates** the project depends on

# Building

```bash
$ cargo build
```

Output is generated in the target/debug directory on build

---

class: left

# Building and Running a project using cargo

* Manually

```bash
$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo
```

* Using Cargo

```bash
$ cargo run
```

* Cargo will rebuild if code is modified or

* Just run the output

---

class: left

# Checking the project

```bash
$ cargo check
```

* Quickly check your code to make sure that it compiles

* It skips the step of producing the executable

* Cargo check is faster than cargo build

---

class: left

# Building for Release

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

* To compile your project with **optimizations**

* Optimizations make Rust code run faster

* But, takes longer to compile

* Creates an executable in target/**release** instead of target/**debug**

---

class: left

# Cargo as Convention

* Provides value with complex projects composed of multiple crates

* As easy as...

```bash
$ git clone someurl.com/someproject
$ cd someproject
$ cargo build
```

# Summary

* `println!("Hello, world!");` prints `Hello, world!` to screen

* **cargo** is the build tool and package manager

* Libraries are called **crates**
