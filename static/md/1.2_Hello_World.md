# Hello, World!

---
class: left

# First program

Create folders

```bash
$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir hello_world
$ cd hello_world
```

In **main.rs** write...

```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Execute

```bash
$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main
Hello, world!
```

# Anatomy of a Rust Program

```rust
fn main() {
  
}
```

* `fn` defines a function

* `main` function inside **main.rs** is the first code that is run

* parameters are provided inside `()`

* function body is wrapped in `{}`

---
class: left

# Anatomy of a Rust Program

```rust
println!("Hello, world!");
```

* `println!` prints text to screen

* `!` indicates that `println!` is a macro

* `"Hello, World!"` is a string literal

* line ends with a `;`

---
class: left

# Compiling and Running Are Separate Steps

Rust is a ahead of time compiled language

* Compiles the program

  ```bash
  $ rustc main.rs
  ```

* Run the program 

  ```bash
  $ ./main
  ```

---
class: left

# Hello, Cargo!

```bash
$ cargo --version
```

* Cargo takes care of 

  * Creating projects

  * building your code 

  * downloading the libraries your code depends on

  * building those libraries

* libraries in Rust are called **crates**

* Installed along with Rust

---
class: left

# Creating a project 

```bash
$ cargo new hello_cargo --bin
```

* **--bin** : Will create an executable application

* **--lib** : Will create a library

* Its a convention to use snake_case for crate names

---
class: left

# Folder structure

```bash
|--- src/main.rs
|--- Cargo.toml
|--- .gitignore
```

* All the source code lives inside the `src` folder

  * main.rs will have a **hello world** example 

        ```rust
        fn main() {
          println!("Hello, world!");
        }
        ```

* `Cargo.toml` contains the configuration

* Cargo by default initializes **git** as VCS and adds **.gitignore**

  * Change it by using the **--vcs** flag

---
class: left

# Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

[dependencies]
```

* TOML is used as Cargoâ€™s configuration format

* [package] lists the name, version, author and other package information

* [dependencies] list all the other crates the project depends on

class: left

# Building 

```bash
$ cargo build
```

output is generated in the target/debug directory on build

---
class: left

# Building and Running a project using cargo

* Manually

```bash
$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo
```
* Using Cargo

```bash
$ cargo run
```

* Cargo will rebuild if code is modified 

* or just run the output

---
class: left

# Checking the project

```bash
$ cargo check
```

* Quickly check your code to make sure that it compiles

* Cargo check is faster than cargo build, because it skips the step of 
  producing the executable

---
class: left

# Building for Release

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

* To compile your project with optimizations

* optimizations make Rust code run faster

* But, takes longer to compile

* Creates an executable in target/**release** instead of target/**debug**

---
class: left

# Cargo as Convention

* Provides value with complex projects composed of multiple crates

* As easy as...

```bash
$ git clone someurl.com/someproject
$ cd someproject
$ cargo build
```

---
class: left

# Summary

* `println!("Hello, world!");` 

* Libraries are called **crates**

* **cargo** is the build tool and package manager
