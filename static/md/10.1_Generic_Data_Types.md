# Using Generic Data Types in Function Definitions

We can define functions that use generics in the signature of the function where the data types of the parameters and return value go

# Example

```rust
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    let mut largest = list[0];
    for &item in list.iter() {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> char {
    let mut largest = list[0];
    for &item in list.iter() {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }
    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);
    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];
    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {}", result);
}
```

class: left

* functions `largest_i32` and `largest_char` have the exact same body

* Type naming convention is 

    *  CamelCase

    * tend to be short by convention, often just one letter

Short for “type”, T is the default choice of most Rust programmers.

Before using the type parameter name in a function signature

We have to declare the type parameter name

Type name declarations go in angle brackets between the name of the function and the parameter list

```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> T {
```

* Read as, function largest is generic over some type T

* It has one parameter named list

* the type of list is a slice of values of type T

* It will return a value of the same type T

# Using Generic Data Types in Struct Definitions

Use `< >` syntax to use generic type parameter in one or more of the struct’s 
  fields

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
```

A Point struct that holds x and y values of type T

* Declare the name of the type parameter within `< >` just after the name of the 
  struct

* Use generic type in the struct definition where we would specify concrete data 
  types

Read as ... Point struct is generic over some type T, and the fields x and y are both that same type

---

class: left

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```

```rust
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 -->
  |
7 |     let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
  |                                      ^^^ expected integral variable, found
  floating-point variable
  |
  = note: expected type `{integer}`
  = note:    found type `{float}`
```

Errors on creating instance of a Point with different types 

The fields `x` and `y` must be the same type because both have the same generic data type `T`

---

class: left

```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}
fn main() {
    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```

A Point generic over two types `T` and `U`, so that x and y may be values of different types

* Use as many generic type parameters in a definition as you want

* using more than a few gets hard to read and understand

* probably a sign that your code could use some restructuring

# Using Generic Data Types in Method Definitions

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}
impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}
fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```

Implementing a method named `x` on the `Point<T>` struct that will return a reference to the `x` field, which is of type `T`

Declaring `T` as a generic type after the impl is how Rust knows the type in the angle brackets in Point is a generic type rather than a concrete type

```rust
impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
```

Dosen't need the be declared next to impl because f32 is a concrete type

* Generic type parameters in a struct definition aren’t always the same generic type parameters you want to use in that struct’s method signatures

* The method takes another Point as a parameter, which might have different types than the self Point that we’re calling mixup on

* The method creates a new Point instance that has the x value from the self Point (which is of type T) and the y value from the passed-in Point (which is of type W):

```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

impl<T, U> Point<T, U> {
    fn mixup<V, W>(self, other: Point<V, W>) -> Point<T, W> {
        Point {
            x: self.x,
            y: other.y,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
    let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c'};

    let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);

    println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);
}
```

* Methods that use different generic types than their struct’s definition

generic parameters `T` and `U` are declared after impl
  * since they go with the struct definition

The generic parameters `V` and `W` are declared after fn mixup
  * since they are only relevant to the method

# Performance of Code Using Generics

* Not any slower than if you had specified concrete types

* Acheived by performing monomorphization of code using generics at compile time

* Monomorphization is the process of turning generic code into specific code with 
  the concrete types that are actually used filled in
