# Types

- Rust is a statically typed language and every value is of a certain `type`

- You can

  - **annotate** the types

  or

  - compiler will **infer** types based on the

    - **value**

      and

    - **how it is used**

---

class: left

# Type inference

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 4;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Rust infers type from the value provided

```rust
fn main() {
  let x;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Rust can't infer, as no value provided and not annotated as well

```rust
error[E0282]: type annotations needed
   --> src/main.rs:230:7
    |   let x;
    |       ^
    |       |
    |       cannot infer type for `_`
    |       consider giving `x` a type
error: aborting due to previous error
```

---

class: left

# Type annotation

```rust
fn main() {
  let x: i32; // type annotated
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Type annotation is provided so Rust won't complain

# Builtin Types

- `scalar`

- `compound`

---

class: left

# Scalar Types

- scalar type represents a single value

  - integers

  - floating-point numbers

  - Booleans, and

  - characters

---

class: left

# integers

Numbers with out decimal points

| Length | Signed  | Unsigned |
| ------ | ------- | -------- |
| 8-bit  | `i8`    | `u8`     |
| 16-bit | `i16`   | `u16`    |
| 32-bit | `i32`   | `u32`    |
| 64-bit | `i64`   | `u64`    |
| arch   | `isize` | `usize`  |

- **Signed** supports positive and negative nubmers and starts with `i`

- **Unsigned** only supports positive numbers and starts with `u`

- Where n is the number of bits that variant uses...

  - signed integter can store -(2<sup>n - 1</sup>) to 2<sup>n - 1</sup> - 1

  - unsigned integter can store `0` to 2<sup>n - 1</sup> - 1

- `isize` and `usize` depend on the computer architecture

- Defaults to i32, generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems

---

class: left

# floating-point numbers

Numbers with decimal points

- Two types

  - f32 : single-precision float

  - f64 : double precision float

- defaults to f64

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 2.0; // f64

  let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

---

class: left

# Numeric Operations

Number types has the usual basic mathematical operations...

```rust
fn main() {
  // addition
  let sum = 5 + 10;

  // subtraction
  let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

  // multiplication
  let product = 4 * 30;

  // division
  let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;

  // remainder
  let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

---

class: left

# Boolean

Specified using `bool`

- `true`

- `false`

```rust
fn main() {
  let t = true; // type infered from value
  let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

---

class: left

# Characters

`char` type is the languageâ€™s most primitive alphabetic type

```rust
fn main() {
  let c = 'z';
  let z = 'â„¤';
  let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

- Specified with **single quotes**, as opposed to strings that use double quotes

- Represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which includes a lot more than just ASCII

- Accented letters, Chinese/Japanese/Korean ideographs, emoji, and zero width spaces

- A **"character"** isnâ€™t really a concept in Unicode, so your human intuition for
  what a **"character"** is may not match up with what a **char** is in Rust

---

class: left

# Compound Types

- Compound types can group multiple values of other types into one type

  - Tuples

  - Arrays

---

class: left

# Tuples

A comma-separated list of values inside parentheses

- Can have different types of values

```rust
fn main() {
  let tup = (500, 6.4, 'X'); // integer, float and char
  let (x, y, z) = tup;
  println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

- Tuple inside a tuple

```rust
let tup = (500, 6.4, ('X', 200));
```

<!-- can tuples be extended -->

---

class: left

# Access Tuples elements

**destructuring** : Access elements through **pattern matching**

```rust
fn main() {
  let tup = (500, 6.4, 'X'); // infered
  let (x, y, z) = tup;

  println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

- Ignore the destructured values with `_`

**dot notation** : Access elements through **.index**

```rust
fn main() {
  let x: (i32, f64, char) = (500, 6.4, 'x');

  let five_hundred = x.0;

  let six_point_four = x.1;

  let one = x.2;
}
```

---

class: left

# Array

A comma-separated list of values inside square brackets

- Single chunk of memory allocated on the stack

- Unlike tuple, every element of an array must be of same type

- arrays are fixed length

```rust
fn main() {
  let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

---

class: left

# Access Array elements

Access individual values in the array by **Indexing**

```rust
fn main() {
  let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  let first = a[0];
  let second = a[1];
}
```

---

class: left

# Invalid Array Element Access

Invalid array element access results in a runtime error

```rust
fn main() {
  let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  let index = 10;
  let element = a[index];
  println!("The value of element is: {}", element);
}
```

- Code will compile

- Results in a runtime error

# Summary

- Rust is a static typed language

- Scalar types like Integers(i32, u64), floating-point numbers(f32, f64), booleans(bool) and characters(char + '')

- Compound types like tuple and Array

- (1, 2.5, 'c') Tuples can be mixed type

- [2, 3, 4; 5] Arrays should be of single type and fixed length
