# Hello, Cargo!

- Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager

- Cargo takes care of

  - Creating projects

  - Building your code

  - Downloading the libraries your code depends on and building those libraries

- Installed along with Rust

  ```bash
  $ cargo --version
  ```

- Libraries or packages of Rust code are called **crates**

---

class: left

# Creating a project

```bash
$ cargo new hello_cargo --bin
```

**--bin** : Will create an executable application

**--lib** : Will create a library

**convention :** Use snake_case for crate names

---

# Folder structure

```bash
|--- src/main.rs
|--- Cargo.toml
|--- .gitignore
```

- All the source code lives inside the `src` folder

  - `main.rs` will have a **hello world** example

    ```rust
    fn main() {
      println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    ```

- `Cargo.toml` contains the configuration

- Cargo by default initializes **git** as VCS and adds **.gitignore**

  - Change it by using the **--vcs** flag

---

class: left

# Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]

[dependencies]
```

- **TOML** is used as Cargo’s configuration format

- **[package]** lists the name, version, author and other package **metadata**

- **[dependencies]** list all the other **crates** the project depends on

# Building

```bash
$ cargo build
```

Output is generated in the target/debug directory on build

---class: left

# Building and Running a Cargo Project

- Manually

```bash
$ ./target/debug/hello_cargo
```

- Using Cargo

```bash
$ cargo run
```

- Cargo will rebuild if code is modified or

- Just run the output

---

class: left

# Checking the project

```bash
$ cargo check
```

- Quickly check your code to make sure that it compiles

- It skips the step of producing the executable

- Cargo check is faster than cargo build

---

class: left

# Building for Release

```bash
$ cargo build --release
```

- To compile your project with **optimizations**

- Optimizations make Rust code run faster

- But, takes longer to compile

- Creates an executable in target/**release** instead of target/**debug**

---

class: left

# Cargo as Convention

- Provides value with complex projects composed of multiple crates

- As easy as...

```bash
$ git clone someurl.com/someproject
$ cd someproject
$ cargo build
```

# Summary

- **cargo** is the build tool and package manager

- Libraries are called **crates**
