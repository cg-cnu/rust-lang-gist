# Iterators

* **Iterator pattern** allows you to perform some task on a sequence of items

* It is responsible for the logic of iterating over each item and determining 
  when the sequence has finished

* **iterators are lazy**, they have no effect until we call methods that consume
  the iterator to use it up

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let v1_iter = v1.iter();
```
