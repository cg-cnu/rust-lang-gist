# Patterns

* A special syntax in Rust for matching against the structure of types, both
  complex and simple

* Using patterns in conjunction with `match` expressions and other constructs
  gives you more control over the control flow of a program

It is made up of some combination of:

  * literals

  * destructured arrays, enums, structs, or tuples

  * variables

  * wildcards

  * placeholders
