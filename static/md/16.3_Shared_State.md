# Shared State Concurrency

* Message passing is a fine way of handling concurrency, but not the only one

* **Message Passing concurrency** in like single ownership :

  * Because once you transfer a value down a channel, you can't use that value. 

* **Shared memory concurrency** is like multiple ownership : 

  * multiple threads can access the same memory location at the same time

  * It adds additional complexity because these different owners need managing. 
  
  * Rust’s type system and ownership rules assist in getting this management correct

# Mutexes Allow Access to Data from One Thread at a Time

* A `mutex` is an abbreviation for “mutual exclusion,” 

* It only allows one thread to access some data at any given time

* `mutex` guards the data it holds via the locking system

* The lock is a data structure that is part of the mutex that keeps track of 
  who currently has exclusive access to the data

* To access the data in a mutex, 

  * a thread must first signal that it wants access 
  
  * by asking to acquire the mutex’s lock

# Mutex Rules

* Mutexes have a reputation for being difficult to use 

* Because you have to remember two rules:

  * Attempt to **acquire the lock** before using the data

  * Once done, **unlock the data** so other threads can acquire the lock

* Management of mutexes can be incredibly tricky to get right

* Rust’s type system and ownership rules, Wont let locking and unlocking go wrong

# The API of `Mutex<T>`

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
fn main() {
    let m = Mutex::new(5);
    {
        let mut num = m.lock().unwrap();
        *num = 6;
    }
    println!("m = {:?}", m);
}
```

* `Mutex::new()` creates a new `mutex`

* `lock` method acquires the lock to access the data inside the mutex

* This call will ...

  * block the current thread until we get the lock

  * would fail if another thread holding the lock panicked
