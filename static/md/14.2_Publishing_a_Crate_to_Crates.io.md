# Making Useful Documentation Comments

* `///` are documentation comments

* Will generate HTML documentation

* Support Markdown notation for formatting 

* Place documentation comments just before the item they’re documenting

```rust
/// Adds one to the number given.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let five = 5;
///
/// assert_eq!(6, my_crate::add_one(5));
/// ```
pub fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

# rustdoc 

* `cargo doc` runs the `rustdoc` distributed with rust

* Generate `html` from the documentation comments 

* In folder `target/doc`

* `cargo doc --open` will build and open the documentation in the browser

# Commonly Used Sections

Sections that crate authors commonly use...

* Panics : If function could panic!, inform the user about it

* Errors : If function returns a Result, the kinds of errors that might occur

* Safety : If the function is unsafe to call explain why

# Documentation Comments as Tests

* Examples in documentation demonstrate how to use the library

* `cargo test` will run the code examples in your documentation as tests!

* So, your examples will allways stay in syc with your code 

* WIP example ?

class: left

# Commenting Contained Items

* //!, adds documentation to the item that contains the comments rather than 
  adding documentation to the items following the comments

* Explain the purpose of the container overall to help your crate users 
  understand your organization.

```rust
//! # My Crate
//!
//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain
//! calculations more convenient.

/// Adds one to the number given.
// --snip--
```

# cargo doc

`cargo doc --open` will generate document and show...

# Exporting a Convenient Public API with pub use

* Structure of your public API is a major consideration when publishing a crate

* `pub use` helps you re-export the public api with out modifying internal 
  organization

* It takes a public item in one location and makes it public in another location,
  as if it was defined in the other location instead

# Re-exporting

Remove the internal organization from the public API and re-export

```rust
//!
//! A library for modeling artistic concepts.

pub use kinds::PrimaryColor;
pub use kinds::SecondaryColor;
pub use utils::mix;

pub mod kinds {
    // --snip--
}

pub mod utils {
    // --snip--
}
```

users can directly access...

```rust
extern crate art;

use art::PrimaryColor;
use art::mix;

fn main() {
    // --snip--
}
```

* `cargo doc` will generate docs which hilight this...

Creating a useful public API structure is more of an art than a science

# Setting Up a Crates.io Account

* Create an account on crates.io and get an API token

```bash
$ cargo login abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345
```

* Its a secret and stored locally in ~/.cargo/credentials

class: left

# Before Publishing a New Crate

Add metadata to the [package] section of the crate’s Cargo.toml file

List of mandatory metadata...

  * name :  All crate names are unique and made available on first come first 
            server basis

  * description : A line describing what your crate does

  * license : A license for your code, eg; "MIT", "MIT OR Apache-2.0"

```toml
[package]
name = "guessing_game"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
description = "A fun game where you guess what number the computer has chosen."
license = "MIT OR Apache-2.0"

[dependencies]
```

# Publishing to Crates.io

* **publish is permanent** 

* A version can never be overwritten, and the code cannot be deleted

* One major goal of crates.io is to act as a permanent archive of code 

```bash
$ cargo publish
 Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
Packaging guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
Verifying guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0
(file:///projects/guessing_game/target/package/guessing_game-0.1.0)
 Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.19 secs
Uploading guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
```

---

class: left

# Publishing a New Version of an Existing Crate

* Change the version value specified in your Cargo.toml file 

* Use Semantic Versioning rules to decide next version number 

* `cargo publish` Uploads the new version

```bash
$ cargo publish 
```


---

class: left

# Removing Versions from Crates.io with cargo yank

* can’t remove previous versions of a crate

* `Yanking` a version prevents 

  * new projects from starting to depend on that version 

  * But, allows all existing projects that depend on it to continue to 
    download and depend on that version

* Essentially ...

  * all projects with a Cargo.lock will not break

  * any future Cargo.lock files generated will not use the yanked version

* Yank won't delete the existing code, prevents projects from depending

* Can't delete the accidentally uploaded secrets

---

class: left

# `yank` and undo

`yank` a version by...

```bash
$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1
```

undo yanking by...

```bash
$ cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
```

# Summary

* `///` are documentation comments and generates HTML documentation

* `//!` are for the entire crate WIP ?

* `pub use` re-exports your public api

* `cargo login <token>` logins into your crates.io account

* `cargo publish` will publish new crate to crates.io

* Crate names are unique and permanent

* Crate versions can't be modified or delete, they can only be yanked
