# Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function

* A technique for dealing with duplication

```rust
n main() {
  let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
  let mut largest = number_list[0];
  for number in number_list {
    if number > largest {
      largest = number;
    }
  }
  println!("The largest number is {}", largest);
}
```

* We noticed there was duplicate code

* We extracted the duplicate code into the body of the function, and specified
  the inputs and return values of that code in the function signature

* We replaced the two concrete places that had the duplicated code to call the  
  function instead

# Summary

* We can use these same steps with generics to reduce code duplication in different ways in different scenarios.

* Like the function body is operating on an abstract list instead of concrete values, code using generics will operate on abstract types.

* What if we had two functions, one that found the largest item in a slice of i32 values and one that found the largest item in a slice of char values? How would we get rid of that duplication?

Letâ€™s find out!
