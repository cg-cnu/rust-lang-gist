# Closures

**Anonymous Functions** that can capture their environment

* Save them in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions

* Create it in one place and call it to evaluate in a different context

* Unlike functions, closures capture values from the scope in which they’re called

* Allow for code reuse and behavior customization

# Defining Closure

```rust
let expensive_closure = |num| {
    println!("calculating slowly...");
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
    num // returned
};
```

* Start with a pair of vertical pipes `(|)`

* Specify the parameters inside it, `|param1, param2|`

* `{}` after the `|` holds the body of the closure

* Optional if the closure body is a single expression

* Ends with a semicolon `;` to finish the `let` statement

* Just like functions, last expression is implicitly returned

# Closure Type Inference and Annotation

Closures unlike functions don’t require to type annotate...

* the parameters or

* the return value

because they are...

* Stored in variables

* Used without naming and exposing to the users of the library

* Short and only relevant within a narrow context

* Annoying to annotate in these small, annonymous functions

Its optional to annotate

# Syntax : Function vs Closure

```rust
// Function definition with type annotation
fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
// Closure definition with type annotation
let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
// Closure with out type annotation
let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
// Closure with body containing single expression
let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;
```

# Type Inference

```rust
let example_closure = |x| x;
let s = example_closure(String::from("hello"));
let n = example_closure(5);
```

```rust
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs
  |
  | let n = example_closure(5);
  |                         ^ expected struct `std::string::String`, found
  integral variable
  |
  = note: expected type `std::string::String`
             found type `{integer}`
```

* Calling a closure whose types are inferred with two different types
  throws an error

* First time we call example_closure with the String value,

  * the compiler infers the type of x and

  * the return type of the closure to be String

* Those types are then locked into the closure in example_closure

* Throws error on calling with different type

# Capturing the Environment with Closures

* Closures can capture their environment and access variables from the scope in
  which they’re defined

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 4;
    let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;
    let y = 4;
    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
```

* `x` is not one of the parameters of `equal_to_x`

* But, the `equal_to_x` closure is allowed to use the x variable

* Access to all variables defined in the same scope that `equal_to_x` is defined
  in

# Capturing environment : Function

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 4;
    fn equal_to_x(z: i32) -> bool { z == x }
    let y = 4;
    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
```

```rust
error[E0434]: can't capture dynamic environment in a fn item; use the || { ...
} closure form instead
 --> src/main.rs
  |
4 |     fn equal_to_x(z: i32) -> bool { z == x }
  |                                          ^
```

Functions can't capture the environment like closures do

# Capturing Values

* Closure uses memory to store the captured values for use in the closure body

* Closures can capture values from their environment in three ways,

* Which directly map to the three ways a function can take a parameter: 

  * taking ownership, 
  
  * borrowing immutably, 
  
  * and borrowing mutably

* These are encoded in the three Fn traits as follows:

  * `FnOnce` take ownership of the variables and move them into the closure’s    
    environment 

  * `Fn` borrows values from the environment immutably

  * `FnMut` can change the environment because it mutably borrows values

* By default, Rust infers which trait to use based on how the closure uses the 
  values from the environment

---

class: left

# Examples

* `equal_to_x` closure borrows `x` immutably (so equal_to_x has the Fn trait) 
  because the body of the closure only needs to read the value in x

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;
    println!("can't use x here: {:?}", x);
    let y = vec![1, 2, 3];
    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
```

* `move` keyword before the parameter list will force the closure to take 
  ownership of the values it uses in the environment

* Useful when passing a closure to a new thread to move the data so it’s owned 
  by the new thread

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;
    println!("can't use x here: {:?}", x);
    let y = vec![1, 2, 3];
    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
```

```rust
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `x`
 --> src/main.rs:6:40
  |
4 |     let equal_to_x = move |z| z == x;
  |                      -------- value moved (into closure) here
5 |
6 |     println!("can't use x here: {:?}", x);
  |                                        ^ value used here after move
  |
  = note: move occurs because `x` has type `std::vec::Vec<i32>`, which does not
  implement the `Copy` trait
```

* Since `equal_to_x` has ownership of `x` we can't use it in the main 

* Respects the ownership and borrowing rules of the data types

* You can start with Fn and the compiler will tell you if you need `FnMut` or 
  `FnOnce` based on what happens in the closure body
