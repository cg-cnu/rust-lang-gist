# Vectors

class: left

# Vectors Store Lists of Values

- Store more than one value in a single data structure

- Puts all the values next to each other in memory

- Implemented using generics

- Also represented as `Vec<T>`

- `Vec<T>` type provided by the standard library can hold any type

- All the values should be of the same type

- Use cases: lines of text in a file, prices of items in a shopping cart

---

# Creating a New Vector

## `vec<T>`

```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```

Creates a new empty vector to hold values of type `i32`

## `vec!` macro

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
```

Rust provides the `vec!` macro for convenience

---

class: left

# Updating a Vector

Create a dummy vector and then add values

```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
```

- Use `mut` to make it mutable

- Infers type from the data, so we don’t need to add Vec<i32> annotation

---

class: left

# Dropping a Vector Drops Its Elements

```rust
{
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    // do stuff with v
} // <- v goes out of scope and is freed here
```

- Vector will be dropped when it goes out of scope

- When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents will also be dropped

- The data, vector holds will be cleaned up

---

class: left

# Reading Elements of Vectors

## `indexing` Syntax

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let third: &i32 = &v[2];
```

- Gives the reference to the element

- Non existent element access will cause a panic!

## `get` Method

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
```

- Get method with the index passed as an argument gives us **Option<&T>**

- Non existent element access will return **None** without panic

---

class: left

# Invalid References

When the program has a valid reference the borrow checker enforces

- **ownership rules**

and

- **borrowing rules**

to ensure references to the contents of the vector remain valid

---

class: left

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first = &v[0];
v.push(6);
```

Attempting to add an element to a vector while holding a reference to an item

```rust
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 -->
  |
4 |     let first = &v[0];
  |                  - immutable borrow occurs here
5 |
6 |     v.push(6);
  |     ^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 |
8 | }
  | - immutable borrow ends here
```

- Can't add an element to a vector while holding a reference to an item

- Adding a new element might require allocating new memory and copying
  the old elements to the new space

---

class: left

# Iterating Over the Values

## With immutable reference to elements

```rust
let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &v {
  println!("{}", i);
}
```

## With mutable reference to elements

```rust
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &mut v {
  *i += 50;
}
```

To change the value we have to use the dereference operator **\***

---

class: left

# Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types

- Vectors can only store values that are of the same type

- This can be inconvenient

- We can use `enum`, because all the variants of an enum are defined under the
  same enum type

```rust
enum SpreadsheetCell {
  Int(i32),
  Float(f64),
  Text(String),
}

let row = vec![
  SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
  SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
  SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
];
```

class: left

# Reason for types in vector

- Explicit about what types are allowed

- How much memory on the heap will be needed to store each element

- Using an enum plus a match expression helps handle every possible case

- If types are not known at compile time, enum technique won’t work

- You can use a trait object, in such case

# Summary

- **Vector** stores more than one value

- Created with **Vec<T>::new()** or **vec![]** macro

- Update a vector with **.push()**

- Read elements of a vector with **index** or **.get()**

- When referencing elements, ownership and borrowing rules are applied

- You can itereate with a for loop using a reference **&** or a mutable reference
  **&mut**

- Since **vec** stores only one type, you can use **enum** to store multiple

- If types are not known at compile time, you can use **traits**
