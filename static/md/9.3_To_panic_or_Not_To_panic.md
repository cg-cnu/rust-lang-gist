# Panic! or Not

* `panic!` can be called for any error situation, recoverable or unrecoverable

* But, You are making the decision on behalf of the code calling your code that 
the error is unrecoverable 

* `Result` will give the option to the callig code to decide wether to panic or not

* Returning `Result` is a good default choice

# Places to `Panic!`

* When it’s possible that your code could end up in a bad state
  
  * The bad state is not something that’s expected to happen occasionally

  * Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state

  * There’s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use

* it’s Perfectly Fine to Panic in 

  * Examples

  * Prototype Code and 

  * Tests  

* When You Have More Information Than the Compiler
