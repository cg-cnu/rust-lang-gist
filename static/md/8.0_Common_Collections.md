# Collections

* Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures
  called collections.

* Most data types represent one specific value, but collections can contain
  **multiple values**

* Unlike the built-in array and tuple types, the data these collections point
  to is stored on the heap, which means

  * amount of data does not need to be known at compile time

  * can grow or shrink as the program runs

* Each kind of collection has different capabilities and costs

* Choosing an appropriate one is a skill you’ll develop over time
