# Public & Private

- The default state of all code in Rust is private

- If you don’t use a private function within your program Rust will warn that
  the function is unused

- When marked public, Rust will stop warning

# Making a function public

- Use `pub` keyword to make module, functions and types public

- The `pub` keyword is placed right before `mod` or `fn`

# Privacy Rules

If an item is

- **public** : Accessed by any of its parent modules

- **private** : Accessed only by...

  - its immediate parent module and

  - any of the parent’s child modules

# Example1

```rust
mod outermost {
    pub fn middle_function() {}
    fn middle_secret_function() {}
    mod inside {
        pub fn inner_function() {}
        fn secret_function() {}
    }
}
fn try_me() {
    outermost::middle_function(); // everybody can access public
    outermost::middle_secret_function(); // immediate parent can access private
    outermost::inside::inner_function(); // anybody can access public function
    outermost::inside::secret_function(); // Not an immediate parent to access private
}
```

# Example1 : Output

```rust
mod outermost {
    pub fn middle_function() {}
    fn middle_secret_function() {}
    mod inside {
        pub fn inner_function() {}
        fn secret_function() {}
    }
}
fn try_me() {
    // public and accessible
    outermost::middle_function();
    // not public
    outermost::middle_secret_function();
    // though inner fucntion is public, inside is not public
    outermost::inside::inner_function();
    // inner fucntion is not public and inside is also not public
    outermost::inside::secret_function();
}
```

# Summary

- The default state of all code in Rust is private

- **pub** will make the item public

- If the item is

  - **public** : It is accessed by any of its parent modules

  - **private** : It is accessed only by

    - its immediate parent module

    and

    - any of the parent’s child modules
