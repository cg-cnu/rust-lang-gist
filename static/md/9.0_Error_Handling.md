# Error Handling

* Rust requires you to acknowledge the possibility of an error occurring 
and take some action before your code will compile

* Two major categories

* Recoverable

* Unrecoverable

Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs, like trying to access a location beyond the end of an array.

Languages have exceptions and treat both of them in the same way

and retry the operation

* Provides `Result<T, E>`

class: left

# Unrecoverable

* Unrecoverable errors are always symptoms of bugs

* like trying to access a location beyond the end of an array

* Provides `panic!` macro that stops execution on unrecoverable errors
