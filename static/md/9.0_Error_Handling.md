# Error Handling

Rust requires you to acknowledge the possibility of an error occurring 
and take some action before your code will compile

Two major categories

  * Recoverable

  * Unrecoverable

Most Languages treat both of them in the same way, using exceptions

class: left

# Recoverable

* Situations in which it’s reasonable to report the problem to the user 
  and retry the operation

* like a file not found error

* Provides `Result<T, E>`
  
---
class: left

# Unrecoverable

* They are always symptoms of bugs

* like trying to access a location beyond the end of an array

* Provides `panic!` macro that stops execution on unrecoverable errors
