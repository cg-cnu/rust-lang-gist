# Using Modules to Reuse and Organize Code

* Module system enables the reuse of code in an organized fashion

* A module is a namespace that contains definitions of functions or types, 
  and you can choose whether those definitions are visible outside their module 
  (public) or not (private).

# Overview

* The mod keyword declares a new module. 

* Code within the module appears either immediately following the declaration 
  within curly brackets or in another file.

* By default, functions, types, constants, and modules are private

* Use `pub` keyword to make them public and visible outside its namespace

* The use keyword brings modules, or the definitions inside modules, into scope 
  so it’s easier to refer to them

# `mod` and the filesystem

* Every module definition in Rust starts with the `mod` keyword, name and block 
  of code `{}`

```rust
mod network {
  fn connect() {
  }
}
```

* Everything in the block `{}` is inside the namespace network

# Multiple `mod`s

We can also have multiple modules in the same `src/lib.rs` file

```rust
mod network {
  fn connect() {
  }
}

mod client {
  fn connect() {
  }
}
```

Function name `connect` don't conflict because they are in different namespaces

# Calling a method

To call function outisde the module we use the `::` syntax

```rust
network::connect();
client::connect();
```

# module inside module

We can put modules inside of modules

```rust
mod network {
  fn connect() {
  }
  mod client {
      fn connect() {
      }
  }
}
```

and access it through...

```rust
network::client::connect()
```

again `connect` won't conflict because they are in different namespaces

# Moving modules to Files

```rust
// in /src/lib.rs
mod client;
mod network;
```

```rust
// in /src/client.rs
fn connect() { }
```

```rust
// in /src/network.rs
fn connect() { }
mod server {
  fn connect() { }
}
```

No need for `mod` declaration, just provides content of the the mod

# Folder structure

```
├── src
│   ├── client.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── network
│       ├── mod.rs
│       └── server.rs
```

Declare `mod` in the main lib file
```rust
// /src/lib.rs
mod network;
mod client;
```

---
class: left

Declare the client module contents

```rust
// /sr/client.rs
fn connect(){

}
```

Declare the network module contents along with server mod declaration

```rust
// /sr/network/mod.rs
mod server;
fn connect(){
  
}
```

Declare the server module contents

```rust
// /src/network/server.rs
fn connect() {

}
```

# Rules of modules with regard to files

* If a module named `foo` has no submodules, you should put the declarations 
  for foo in a file named foo.rs.

* If a module named `foo` does have submodules, you should put the declarations 
  for foo in a file named foo/mod.rs.
