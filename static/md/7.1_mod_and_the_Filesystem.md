# Module System

Module system enables the reuse of code in an organized fashion

* A module is a namespace that contains definitions of functions or types

* choose whether those definitions

  * visible outside their module (public)

  or

  * not (private)

---

class: left

# `mod` and the filesystem

* `$ cargo new hello_world --bin` will create a binary, remove `--bin` to create
  a library

* Use `cargo build` to build the library

---

class: left

# Module Definitions

```rust
mod network {
  fn connect() {
  }
}
```

* The `mod` keyword followd by the module name declares a new module

* Code within the module appears either immediately following the declaration
  within curly brackets or in another file

* Everything in the block `{}` is inside the namespace network

---

class: left

# Multiple `mod`s

We can also have multiple modules in the same file

```rust
// in `src/lib.rs`
mod network {
  fn connect() {
  }
}

mod client {
  fn connect() {
  }
}
```

Function name `connect` don't conflict because they are in different namespaces

---

class: left

# Calling a method

To call function outisde the module, use the `::` syntax

```rust
network::connect();
client::connect();
```

---

class: left

# module inside module

We can put modules inside of modules

```rust
mod network {
  fn connect() {
  }
  mod client {
      fn connect() {
      }
  }
}
```

and access it through...

```rust
network::client::connect()
```

Again, `connect` won't conflict because they are in different namespaces

class: left

# Moving modules to Files

```rust
// in /src/lib.rs
mod client;
mod network;
```

```rust
// in /src/client.rs
fn connect() { }
```

```rust
// in /src/network.rs
fn connect() { }
mod server {
  fn connect() { }
}
```

* In network.rs and client.rs, no need for `mod` declaration, just provides
  content of the the module.

* Where as for server you need to declare `mod` as it is inside network.rs

# Folder structure

```text
├── src
│   ├── client.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── network
│       ├── mod.rs
│       └── server.rs
```

Declare `mod` in the main lib file

```rust
// /src/lib.rs
mod network;
mod client;
```

---

class: left

Declare the client module contents in client.rs

```rust
// /sr/client.rs
fn connect(){

}
```

Declare the network module contents along with server `mod` declaration in mod.rs

```rust
// /sr/network/mod.rs
mod server;
fn connect(){

}
```

Declare the server module contents in server.rs

```rust
// /src/network/server.rs
fn connect() {

}
```

# Rules of modules with regard to files

* If a module named `foo` has

  * submodules : Put the declarations for foo in a file named foo/mod.rs

  * no submodules : Put the declarations for foo in a file named foo.rs

* These rules apply recursively

* Modules should be declared in their parent module’s file using the `mod`
  keyword

---

class: left

# Summary

* Module provides namespaces and helps organize code

<!-- * By default everything is private, use `pub` to make it public -->

* `mod` declares a module and you can call it with `::`

* If a module has submodules, put the declarations in a file named foo/mod.rs
