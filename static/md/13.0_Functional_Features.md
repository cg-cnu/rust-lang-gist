# Functional Programming

* Rust is significantly inspired by functional programming

* Programming in a functional style often includes using functions as values 

    * by passing them in arguments, 

    * returning them from other functions, 

    * assigning them to variables for later execution, and so forth

# Functional Features

**Closures :** A function-like construct you can store in a variable

**Iterators :** A way of processing a series of elements

* Master closures and iterators to write idiomatic and fast Rust code

* Pattern matching and enums are also influenced by Functional Style

# Summary

* Rust also has Functional Concepts along with OOP

* Closures and Iterators are the most useful apart from Pattern matching and 
  enums
