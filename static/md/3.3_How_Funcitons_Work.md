# How Functions Work

# Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    another_function();
}
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

* `fn` declares a function

* `main` function is the default entry point for the program

* `snake_case` is the convention for function names

* You can access functions above their declaration, Rust dosen't care where your
  functions are declared

---

class: left

# Function Parameters

Special variables that are part of a functionâ€™s signature

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

* `x: i32` declare parameter with type

* Multiple parameter declarations are Separated with commas

---

class: left

# Statements

Instructions that perform some action and do not return a value

* `let y = 6;` is a statement

* You can't `let x = (let y = 6);`

* `(let y = 6);` is a statement, dosen't return any value

---

class: left

# Expressions

Instructions that return a value

* Expressions always evaluate to a resulting value

* `5 + 6` is an expression

* In `let y = 6;` `6` is an expression resulting in the value `6`

* Calling a function, macro and new scopes `{}` are expressions

---

class: left

# Statements and Expressions

Adding a semicolon to the end of an expression, makes it a statement

---

class: left

# Functions with Return Values

* Functions can return values

* We declare their type after an arrow `-> i32`

* Return type is synonymous with the value of the final expression

* Return early using `return` keyword or last expression is returned implicitly

**convention :** The official style is **"return is only for early returns"**

* Functions that dosen't return anything explicityly returns empty tuple `()`

---

class: left

# macros

* Macros unlike functions end with an exclamation `!`

* Macros expand at compile time to more complex function calls

---

class: left

# Example 1

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}
```

* 5 is the last expression and it is returned implicitly

---

class: left

# Example 2

```rust
fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}
```

```rust
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:7:28
  |
7 |   fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
  |  ____________________________^
8 | |     x + 1;
  | |          - help: consider removing this semicolon
9 | | }
  | |_^ expected i32, found ()
  |
  = note: expected type `i32`
             found type `()`
```

* Expect the return type `i32`

* `x+1` evaluates to an expression and give an `i32` but `;` makes it a statement

* Since nothing is explicitly returned an empty tuple `()` is returned

* Panics with `mismatched types` error

# Summary

* `main` is the entry point

* `fn` declares a function

* Function implicitly returns the last expression

* Return explicitily with `return` keyword

* Else will return an empty tuple `()`
