# How Functions Work

# Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    another_function();
}
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

* `fn` declares a function

* `main` function is the default entry point for the program

* `snake_case` is the convention for function names

* You can access functions above their declaration

---
class: left

# Function Parameters

Special variables that are part of a functionâ€™s signature

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```
* separate multiple parameter declarations with commas

---
class: left

# Statements

Instructions that perform some action and do not return a value

* `let y = 6;`  is a statement

* You can't `let x = (let y = 6);` because `(let y = 6);` is a statement, 
  dosen't return any value

---
class: left

# Expressions

Instructions that return a value

* Expressions allways evaluate to a resulting value

* `5 + 6` is an expression

* In `let y = 6;`  6 is an expression

* Calling a function, macro and new scopes `{}` are expressions

---

# Statements and Expressions

* Adding a semicolon to the end of an expression, makes it a statement

<!-- give more examples and variations -->

---
class: left

# Functions with Return Values

* Functions can return values

* We declare their type after an arrow `->`

* Return type is synonymous with the value of the final expression

* Return early using `return` keyword or last expression implicitly

---
class: left

# macros

* Macros unlike functions end with an `!`

* Macros expand at compile time to more complex function calls

---
class: left

# Example 1

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}
```

* 5 is the last expression and it is returned implicitly

* Functions that dosen't return anything returns empty tuple `()`

---
class: left

# Example 2

```rust
fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}
```

```rust
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:7:28
  |
7 |   fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
  |  ____________________________^
8 | |     x + 1;
  | |          - help: consider removing this semicolon
9 | | }
  | |_^ expected i32, found ()
  |
  = note: expected type `i32`
             found type `()`
```

* expect the return type `i32`

* `x+1` evaluates to an expression and give an `i32` but `;` makes it a statement
  and returns an empty tuple `()`

* panics with `mismatched types` error.

# Summary

* `main` is the entry point 

* `fn` declares a function

* function implicitly returns the last expression

* else will return an empty tuple `()`

* you can explicitly return with `return` keyword
