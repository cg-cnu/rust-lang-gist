# Vectors

class: left

# Vectors Store Lists of Values

* Vector also represented as `Vec<T>`

* store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values 
  next to each other in memory

* Can only store values of the same type

---
class: left

# Creating a New Vector

* function

```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```

* macro

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
```

# Updating a Vector

Create a dummy vector and then add values

```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
```

*** ? 
* The numbers we place inside are all of type i32, and Rust infers this from the data, so we don’t need the Vec<i32> annotation.

# Reading Elements of Vectors

Two ways to reference a value stored in a vector, which helps how the program 
behaves when you try to use an index value that the vector doesn’t have an element for.

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let third: &i32 = &v[2];
```

* gives the reference to the third element
* Non existent element access will cause a panic!

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
```

* get method with the index passed as an argument gives us Option<&T>.
* Non existent element access will return `None` without panicking

# Invalid References

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first = &v[0];
v.push(6);
```

* Can't add an element to a vector while holding a reference to an item

* reason: adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require 
allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space. 
In that case, the reference to the first element would be pointing to 
deallocated memory.(dangling references) 
The borrowing rules prevent programs from ending up in that situation.

# Iterating Over the Values in a Vector

* with immutable reference to elements

```rust
let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &v {
  println!("{}", i);
}
```

* with mutable reference to elements

```rust
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &mut v {
  *i += 50;
}
```

To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the 
dereference operator (*) to get to the value in i before we can use the += operator

# Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types

* Vectors can only store values that are the same type

* The variants of an enum are defined under the same enum type, 
  so we cab use an enum!

```rust
enum SpreadsheetCell {
  Int(i32),
  Float(f64),
  Text(String),
}

let row = vec![
  SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
  SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
  SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
];
```

* Explicit about what types are allowed in this vector

* Rust needs to know types in a vector at compile time to assign exactly how 
  much memory on the heap will be needed to store each element

* Using an enum plus a match expression means that we always handle every possible case
