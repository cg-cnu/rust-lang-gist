### 3.1
# Variables and Mutability

---
class: left
# Variables

* Variables are declared using `let`

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

```rust
The value of x is: 5
```

---
class: left

# Constants

* Constants are declared using `const`

```rust
fn main() {
  const PIG_COUNT = 5;
  println!("The total no of pigs are: {}", PIG_COUNT);
}
```


```rust
The total no of pigs are: 5
```

* Use all upper case with underscores between words
* Valid for the entire run of the program in the defined scope

---

# Variables and Mutability

* Variables are immutable by default
```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
  x = 6;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

```rust
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - first assignment to `x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
```

---
class: left

* add `mut` to make variables mutable

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut x = 5;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
  x = 6;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

```rust
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6
```

# Immutable vs Constants

* `immutable` is different from `const`
* Constants aren’t only immutable by default, they’re always immutable
* Can't assgin functions to `const`
* Can't use `mut` with `constants`

---
class: left

# Shadowing

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;

  let x = x + 1;

  let x = x * 2;

  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```
* When declaring a new variable using `let` with the same name as the old variable,
the new variable is shadowing the old one.
* Shadowing helps perform transformations on immutable variables
* Shadowing effectively creates a new variable with the same name

---
class: left

# Mutable vs Shadowing

* `mut` changes the value where as `shadowing` creates a new variable
* This gives the flexibility of changing the types of the variable

```rust
let spaces = "   "; // type of String
let spaces = spaces.len(); // type of integer
```

---

# Summary

* `let` declares a variable
* `mut` makes it mutable 
* `const` declares a constant
* `const` can't be mutable
* `shadowing` creates new variable
