# Slices

---
class: left

# Slices

Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection

---
class: left

# String Slices

* string[start..end]

* start..end syntax is a range that begins at start and continues up to, but not including, end

* Slice will store pointer to the staring_index and the length 

* [0..end] and [..end] slices from beginning

* [start..len] and [start..] slices till the end

# Summary

* Ownership, borrowing, and slices ensure memory safety in Rust programs at compile time. 

* You control the memory usage by using the ownership rules and Rust automatically 
  clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope
