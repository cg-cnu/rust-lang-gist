# Recoverable Errors with Result

# Recoverable Errors

* Most errors aren’t serious enough to stop the program entirely

* When a function fails, it’s for a reason that we can easily interpret and 
respond to

* If we try to open a file and that operation fails because the file doesn’t 
exist, we might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.

# `Result`

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

* `T` and `E` are generic type parameters

* `T` represents the type of the value that will be 
  * returned in a success case 
  * within the Ok variant

* `E` represents the type of the error that will be 
  * returned in a failure case 
  * within the Err variant

---
class: left

* Because `Result` has these generic type parameters, we can use the Result 
  type and the functions that the standard library has defined on it in many 
  different situations where the successful value and error value we want to 
  return may differ
