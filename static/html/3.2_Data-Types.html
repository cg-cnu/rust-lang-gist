# Data Types

---
class: left

# Types

* Rust is a statically typed language and every value is of a certain `type`

* You can assign the types or compiler will infers types based on the `value` 
  and `how it is used`

* In case if it can't you have to provide `type annotations`

---
class: left

# Type inference

```rust
fn main() {
  let x;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

Rust can't infer since no value is given

```rust
fn main() {
  let x: i32;
  println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```
Type annotation is provided, so don't throw error

class: left

# Builtin Types

* `scalar` and `compound`

---
class: left

# Scalar Types

* scalar type represents a single value

* integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters

---
class: left

# integers

* Numbers with out decimal points

Length 	Signed 	Unsigned
8-bit 	i8 	u8
16-bit 	i16 	u16
32-bit 	i32 	u32
64-bit 	i64 	u64
arch 	isize 	usize 

* defaults to i32 and 

---
class: left

# floating-point numbers

* Numbers with decimal points

* f32 and f64

* defaults to f64

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 2.0; // f64

  let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

---
class: left

# Boolean

* `true` & `false`

* Specified using `bool`

```rust
fn main() {
  let t = true; 
  let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

---
class: left

# Characters

* `char` type is the languageâ€™s most primitive alphabetic type, 

```rust
fn main() {
  let c = 'z';
  let z = 'â„¤';
  let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

* represents a Unicode Scalar Value

* ASCII, Accented letters, Chinese/Japanese/Korean ideographs, emoji, and zero 
  width spaces

---
class: left

# Compound Types

* Compound types can group multiple values of other types into one type

* Tuples and Arrays

<!-- what about strings ? -->

---
class: left

# Tuples

* a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses

* Can have different types of values

* Access elements by destructuring through pattern matching 

```rust
fn main() {
  let tup = (500, 6.4, 'X'); // infered
  let (x, y, z) = tup;

  println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```
<!-- can tuples be extended -->

---
class: left

* Can also access through dot notation

```rust
fn main() {
  let x: (i32, f64, char) = (500, 6.4, 'x');

  let five_hundred = x.0;

  let six_point_four = x.1;

  let one = x.2;
}
```

---
class: left

# Array

* A comma-separated list of values inside square brackets

* Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must be of same type

* arrays are fixed length

```rust
fn main() {
  let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

---
class: left

# Access elements

* Invalid array element access results in a runtime error 

* Access individual values in the array by `Indexing`

```rust
fn main() {
  let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  let first = a[0];
  let second = a[1];
}
```

<!-- ** tuple of tuples and array of arrays -->

---
class: left

# Summary

* Rust is a static typed language

* Scalar types like Integers, floating-point numbers, booleans and characters

* Compound types like tuple and Array

* Tuples can be mixed type 

* Arrays should be single type and fixed length
