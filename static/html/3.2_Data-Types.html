# Data Types

class: left

# Types

* Rust is a statically typed language and every value is of a certain `type`

* You can assign the types or compiler infer types based on the `value` and `how it is used`

* In case if it can't you have to provide `type annotations`

* Built in types are `scalar` and `compound`

---
class: left

# Scalar Types

* scalar type represents a single value

* integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters

---
class: left

# integers

* Numbers with out decimal points

Length 	Signed 	Unsigned
8-bit 	i8 	u8
16-bit 	i16 	u16
32-bit 	i32 	u32
64-bit 	i64 	u64
arch 	isize 	usize 

* defaults to i32 and 

---
class: left

# floating-point numbers

* Numbers with decimal points

* f32 and f64

* defaults to f64

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 2.0; // f64

  let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

---
class: left

# Boolean

* `true` & `false`

* Specified using `bool`

```rust
fn main() {
  let t = true; 
  let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

---
class: left

# Characters

* `char` type is the languageâ€™s most primitive alphabetic type, 

```rust
fn main() {
  let c = 'z';
  let z = 'â„¤';
  let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

* represents a Unicode Scalar Value

* ASCII, Accented letters, Chinese/Japanese/Korean ideographs, emoji, and zero width spaces

---
class: left

# Compound Types

* Compound types can group multiple values of other types into one type

* Tuples and Arrays

---
class: left

# Tuples

* a comma-separated list of values inside parentheses

* Can have different types of values

* Access elements by...

* Destructuring, through pattern matching 

```rust
fn main() {
  let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

  let (x, y, z) = tup;

  println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

---
class: left

* Access through `.`

```rust
fn main() {
  let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

  let five_hundred = x.0;

  let six_point_four = x.1;

  let one = x.2;
}
```

---
class: left

# Array

* A comma-separated list of values inside square brackets

* Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type

* arrays are fixed length

* Access elements by `Indexing`

```rust
fn main() {
  let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  let first = a[0];
  let second = a[1];
}
```
* Invalid array element access results in a runtime error 

** tuple of tuples and array of arrays
