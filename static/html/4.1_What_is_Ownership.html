### 4.1

# Ownership

---
class: left

# Memory

* Parts of memory that is available to your code to use at runtime

* They are structured in two ways, stack and heap

---
class: left

# Stack 

* The stack stores values in the order it gets and removes in the opposite order

* This is referred to as last in, first out (LIFO) 

* Adding data is called `push`ing onto the stack

* Removing data is called `pop`ping off the stack

* Fast, because of the way it accesses data

* All data should take up fixed size

---
class: left

# Heap

* Heap is less organized

* On requesting, os will find a space, mark it as use and then returns the address

* Address is called `Pointer`

* Process of allocating memory is called `allocation on the heap` or simply `allocation`

<!-- ** deallocation ?  -->

* Slow, because we have to follow a pointer to get there

* Data is of varied sizes, lage data takes more time to allocate

---
class: left

# Memory Management

Different styles of memory management...

* Garbage collection, a program that constantly looks for unused memory and cleans at run-time

* Manual, programmer must explicitly allocate and free the memory 

* Follow a set of `ownership rules` that the compiler checks at compile time with no run-time cost

Rust falls under the third category

---
class: left

# Ownership

Ownership defines a set of rules which takes care of 

* keeping track of what parts of code are using

* what data on the heap

* minimizing the amount of duplicate

* cleaning up

* No need to think of stack and heap once you start following ownership rules.
---
class: left

# Ownership Rules

* Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner

* There can only be one owner at a time

* When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

---
class: left

# Variable Scope

```rust
{                      
                      // s is not valid here, it’s not yet declared
  let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward

  // do stuff with s
}                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
```

---
class: left

# Memory and Allocation

<!-- * String literals since immutable are hard coded into the executable 

* In case of mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate memory on heap -->

```rust 
let mut s = String::from("hello");

s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String

println!("{}", s); // This will print `hello, world!`
```

* Memory allocated by os at run time during `let mut s = String::from("hello");`

* Memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope

* Rust calls `drop` automatically at the closing `}`

---
class: left

# Ways Variables and Data Interact:

Variables and data interact in three ways...

* Move

* Clone 

* Copy

---
class: left

# Move

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;
```

* Allocate the heap for `hello` and push onto stack for the pointer, length and capacity with variable s1

* Copy the stack memory to the new variable s2

* Invalidate s1 as both of them are pointing to the same heap because rust can't decide which one to drop at the end of the scope

---
class: left

# Clone

```rust

let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("s1 = {}, s2 = {}", s1, s2);
```

* Allocate the heap for `hello` and push onto stack for the pointer, length and capacity with variable s1

* Clone the stack memory and heap memory to the new variable s2

---
class: left

# Copy

Happens for Stack-only data

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;
```

* Bind the value 5 to x and copy the value of x and bind it to y

* Not a move operation because, 5 is an integer of known size and allocated in stack

* There is no difference between deep and shallow Copy

* Any group of simple scalar types can be Copy

* Tuples, but only if they contain types that are also Copy. (i32, i32) is Copy, but (i32, String) is not.

---
class: left

# Ownership and Functions

* Passing a variable to a function will move or copy, just like assignment based on the type

---
class: left

```rust
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope.
  takes_ownership(s); // s's value moves into the function...
                      // ... and so is no longer valid here.
  let x = 5;          // x comes into scope.
  makes_copy(x);      // x would move into the function,
                      // but i32 is Copy, so it’s okay to still
                      // use x afterward.
} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. 
// But since s's value was moved, nothing
// special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope.
  println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
// memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope.
  println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

---
class: left

# Return Values and Scope

* Returning a variable from a function will move or copy, just like assignment based on the type

---
class: left

```rust
fn main() {
  let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope.

  takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                  // ... and so is no longer valid here.

  let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope.

  makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                  // but i32 is Copy, so it’s okay to still
                                  // use x afterward.

} // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. But since s's value was moved, nothing
// special happens.

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope.
  println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
// memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope.
  println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```
