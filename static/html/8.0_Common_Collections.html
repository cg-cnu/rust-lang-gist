# Common Collections

# Collections

* Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures 
  called collections.

* Most other data types represent one specific value, but collections can 
  contain multiple values 
  
* Unlike the built-in array and tuple types, the data these collections point 
  to is stored on the heap, which means the amount of data does not need to be 
  known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs
  
* Each kind of collection has different capabilities and costs, and choosing an 
  appropriate one for your current situation is a skill you’ll develop over time

# Types of Collections

The major three types of collections commonly used are...

* vector: store a variable number of values next to each other

* string: a collection of characters

* hash map: associate a value with a particular key.
  It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a map
