# Unrecoverable Errors with panic!

---
class: left

# `panic!` macro

* program will print a failure message

* unwind and clean up the stack or abort

* and then quit. 

---
class: left

# Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a panic!

* Unwinding 

* Rust walks back the stack and clean up the data from each funciton 

* Take a lot of work and resulting binary will be large

* Unwinding 

* Ends the program with out cleanup and OS will clean the data 

* Process will end quickly and the resulting binary will be small

# Config

Add `panic = 'abort'` to the appropirate profile 

```TOML
[profile.release]
panic = 'abort'
```
If you want to abort on panic in release mode

# Example

Call it intentionally 

```rust
fn main() {
  panic!("crash and burn");
}
```

```rust
$ cargo run
Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25 secs
Running `target/debug/panic`
thread 'main' panicked at 'crash and burn', src/main.rs:2:4
note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.
```

caused by another issue...

```rust
fn main() {
  let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

  v[99];
}
```

# Using a panic! Backtrace

* A backtrace is a list of all the functions that have been called to get to 
  this point

* set the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to get a backtrace of exactly 
  what happened to cause the error.

* The key to reading the backtrace is to start from the top and read until 
  you see files you wrote
