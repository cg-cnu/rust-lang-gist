# Validating References with Lifetimes

---
class: left

# Lifetimes

* reference has a lifetime, which is the scope for which that reference is valid

* Just like **types**, lifetimes are implicit and inferred

* Types are annotated, when they can't be infered or multiple types are possible

* Lifetimes are annotated, using generic lifetime parameters 

* Rust’s most distinctive feature

# Lifetimes Prevent Dangling References

* Prevent dangling references, reference data other than the data we’re 
  intending to reference

```rust
{
  let r;
  {
      let x = 5;
      r = &x;
  }
  println!("r: {}", r);
}
```
