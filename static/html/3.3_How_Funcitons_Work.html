# How Functions Work

---
class: left

# Functions

* `fn` declares a function

* `main` function is the default entry point for the program

* `snake_case` is the convention for function names

* You can access functions above their declaration

---
class: left

# Function Parameters

* special variables that are part of a functionâ€™s signature

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```
* separate multiple parameter declarations with commas

---
class: left

# Statements

* Instructions that perform some action and do not return a value

```rust
let y = 6;
```
* You can't 

```rust
let x = (let y = 6);

```

because `(let y = 6);` is a statement, dosen't return any value

---
class: left

# Expressions

* Instructions that perform some action and return a value

* Expressions allways evaluate to a resulting value

* In `let y = 6;`  6 is an expression

* `5 + 6` is an expression

* Calling a function, macro and new scopes `{}` are expressions

---
class: left

# Statements and Expressions

* Adding a semicolon to the end of an expression, makes it a statement
<!-- give more examples and variations -->

---
class: left

# Functions with Return Values

* Functions can return values
* Return type is synonymous with the value of the final expression
* Return early using `return` keyword or last expression implicitly

---
class: left

# Example 1
*
```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}
```

* 5 is the last expression and it is returned implicitly

---
class: left

# Example 2

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    // Do we need the semicolon here... ?
}
```

---
class: left

# Example 3

```rust
fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}
```
* expect the return type `i32`
* `x+1` evaluates to an expression and give an `i32` but `;` makes it a statement
  and returns nothing
* panics with `mismatched types` error.
