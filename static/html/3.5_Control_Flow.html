# Control Flow

---
class: left

# `if` Expressions

```rust
fn main() {
  let number = 3;
  if number < 5 {
      println!("condition was true");
  } else {
      println!("condition was false");
  }
}
```

* Starts with **if** keyword

* Follwed by condition, which should evaluate to boolean

* Rust won't convert non boolean types to booleans

* block of code in **{}** called **arms** is executed based on condition

---
class: left

# `else` expression

* else expression is optional

* evalutes if the **if expression** condition is false

---
class: left

# **else if** expression

* multiple conditions with **else if**

---
class: left

# Using **if** in a **let** statement

* since `if` is an expression we can use it in a statement and assign to a variable.

```rust
let number = if condition {
  5 // expression
} else {
  6 // expression
} // expression; // statement
```

* Arms of the if expressions should be of same type

```rust
let number = if condition {
  5 // expression
} else {
  "six" // expression
} // expression; // statement
```

---
class: left

# Repetition with Loops

* Execute a block of code more than once

* Three types of loops, **loop**, **while** and **for**

---
class: left

# Loop

* Execute a block of code over and over, until you explicitly tell it to stop

```rust
fn main() {
  loop {
      println!("again!");
  }
}
```

* Cancel with `ctrl+c`

* Or gracefully cancel with a `break` keyword

---
class: left

# While

* Execute a block of code while a condition holds true

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut number = 3;

  while number != 0 {
      println!("{}!", number);

      number = number - 1;
  }

  println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

---
class: left

# For

* Loop over the elements of a collection, such as an array

```rust
fn main() {
  let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
  for element in a.iter() {
      println!("the value is: {}", element);
  }
}
```

* or a range

```rust
fn main() {
  for number in (1..4) {
      println!("{}!", number);
  }
  println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

---

# Summary

* **if** and **else if** expression should have condition which evaluates to boolean

* Blocks of code called **arms** are executed based on the condition value and 
  all the arms should be of same type

* **if** can be used in a statement and assigned to a variable

* **loop** executes for ever untill **break**

* **while** executes untill the condition is true

* **for** executes for each element in the Arrary or range
