# `if` Expressions

```
fn main() {
  let number = 3;

  if number < 5 {
      println!("condition was true");
  } else {
      println!("condition was false");
  }
}
```

* Starts with `if` keyword
* Follwed by condition, which should evaluate to boolean
* Won't convert non boolean types to booleans
* and block of code in `{}` called `arms`

---

# `else` expression

* else expression is optional
* evalutes if the condition is false


---
class: middle, left

# `else if` expression

* multiple conditions with `else if`


---
class: middle, left

# Using `if` in a `let` statement

* since `if` is an expression we can use it in a statement and assign to a variable.

```rust
let number = if condition {
  5 // expression
} else {
  6 // expression
} // expression; // statement
```

* Arms of the if expressions should be of same type

```rust
let number = if condition {
  5 // expression
} else {
  "six" // expression
} // expression; // statement
```

is invalid

# Repetition with Loops

* Execute a block of code more than once
* Three types of loops, `loop`, 'while' and `for`

---
class: middle, left

# Loop

* Execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.

```rust
fn main() {
  loop {
      println!("again!");
  }
}
```
* Cancel with `ctrl+c`
* Or gracefully with a `break` keyword

---
class: middle, left

# While

* While a condition holds true, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut number = 3;

  while number != 0 {
      println!("{}!", number);

      number = number - 1;
  }

  println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

---
class: middle, left

# For

* loop over the elements of a collection, such as an array

```rust
fn main() {
  let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

  for element in a.iter() {
      println!("the value is: {}", element);
  }
}
```
* or a range
```rust
fn main() {
  for number in (1..4) {
      println!("{}!", number);
  }
  println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```
