# References and Borrowing

---
class: left

# References

* let a function use a value but not take ownership

* You pass reference by appending with `&`

```rust
fn main() {
  let s1 = String::from("hello");

  let len = calculate_length(&s1);

  println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
  s.len()
}
```

---
class: left

# &ref

* arguments and parameters are prepended with `&`

* `&` lets you refer to some value without taking ownership of it

* Since we don't have ownership, 
  
  * No need to return the values to give back ownership
  
  * Rust won't `drop` when it goes out of scope

---
class: left

# Mutable References

* Like variables, references are also immutable by default.

* Need to use `mut` to makeit mutable

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut s = String::from("hello");

  change(&mut s);
}
fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
  some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

# The Rules of References

* One mutable reference, in a particular scope

or

* Any number of immutable references.

and 

* References must always be valid.

# One mutable reference

You can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope

```
let mut s = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &mut s;
let r2 = &mut s;
```

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
{
    let r1 = &mut s;
} // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.
let r2 = &mut s;
```

---
class: left

# Can't mix mutable and immutable references

```rust 
let mut s = String::from("hello");
let r1 = &s; // no problem
let r2 = &s; // no problem
let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
```

# Data Race

A data race is similar to a race condition and happens when these three behaviors occur...

* Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.

* At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.

* There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

* limited mutable references prevents this data race from happening

---
class: left

# Dangline References

* a pointer that may have been given to someone else while preserving a pointer to that memory
* Rust guarentees that the data will not go out of scope before the reference to the data does.

```rust
fn main() {
  let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
}
fn dangle() -> &String {
  let s = String::from("hello");
  &s
}
```
* s is created inside dangle and deallocated on `}`. 
* But we tried to return a reference to it, which is pointing to an invalid String! 
* Rust won’t let us do this.
